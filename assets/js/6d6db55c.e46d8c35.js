Every now and then the \"puffin bus\" would ease past us and we'd have an image of rather more leisurely tourists gazing out of the window at the scenery as they were transported up hill and down dale. To our surprise, the landscape featured a good number of old abandoned cars. Presumably, if a car breaks down, it's pretty difficult to get it back up the road and onto the boat to Ireland. So instead, vehicles are left to moulder when they break."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"People often say of English weather, that you can have four seasons in a day. Ireland is that premise on steroids. It's entirely possible to experience four seasons in ten minutes. And two of them may well be winter.

Then we'd do it all over again."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That level of variety in the weather is pretty tedious to my mind. But it did make me ponder what the consequences of living in that sort of weather perpetually might be. Irish people are, on average, far friendlier than English. Of course that's subjective, but I still think it's pretty accurate. I had more casual chats with folk in an afternoon in Ireland than in a month in London.

By the time we got there it was heading for two o\'clock and it was apparent that we wouldn\'t be able to walk back to the boat on time. No problem, we thought, we can catch the bus back. I approached the driver who had just arrived and asked him if we could buy tickets to get back to the boat. "Well now", said the driver, "I\'m not sure if there\'s space, but be ye here in an hour and we\'ll find out!" He seemed very upbeat in his response, but as I parsed his meaning I thought I\'d better seek clarification.

Given that Francis had given us an opportunity, at the least, we decided the best we could do was take it. There followed an hour where we sought to see puffins through binoculars, and possibly did, but they flew past so quickly it was hard to appreciate the experience a great deal. Also, when the possibility of potential drama is present, it's a little tricky to experience the moment. Certainly Benjamin, our oldest, was demonstrating that he'd inherited his father's desire that things go according to plan, and attendant anxiety when they do not, or threaten not too."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Ben ran up and down at the bus stop wailing \"we're totally screwed..\u2026\" This did not aid his father's anxiety one jot.

All seemed lost, and Francis could see the crestfallen expression on our faces."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"We'll find a way\" he said. And after a certain amount of negotiation, we found ourselves on board, with various Reillys sat on one another and sharing seats. I found myself sat on the floor of the bus, surrounded by legs, but entirely grateful to be on the vehicle. It started swaying its way back to the boat. Every now and then Francis would pause the bus to tell a story, point out where a viking was buried, where Robert the Bruce may have hidden and draw everyone's attention to a seal frolicking in the sea. I saw none of this, from my vantage point on the floor."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This was fine. We were going to make it back to Ireland, unlike all those abandoned cars.
