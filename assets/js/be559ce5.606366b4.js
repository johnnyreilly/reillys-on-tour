(Not good if you\'re feeling the need to wrap up spare clothes in a sheet swaddling-style to carry around with you so fit in.) Ever seeking a little local expertise we sought the opinion of, I guess, a "Lantan" and asked to be directed to a more "backpacker-y" type place. She considered carefully and directed us to a beach called Klong Nin. Following her lead we rocked up to a the bungalows she\'d directed us too: "Is this definitely it - looks like the last place?" "That\'s the name she gave us. Rooms look about the same. Still quite heavy on the screaming baby front...." "Tonka toys floating in the pool; check. Can\'t really see any difference..." "Oh look, drugs!" Yes, sure enough, this residence was to all intents and purposes identical to the last, the conspicuous difference was that this place retailed narcotics. It wasn\'t shy about it either, it wasn\'t the case of a darkened room out of which people would furtively dart concealing contraband about their person. No. This stuff featured on the menu. Right next to the Margarita there was the "Mushroom Shake", and next to that the "Bhang Lassi". The list went on. Pondering matters a little further we have come to the conclusion that the term "backpacker" has become something of a euphemism in Lanta. If you say "backpacker" what they hear is "show us your class b\'s and c\'s". One of life\'s little learning exercises.
