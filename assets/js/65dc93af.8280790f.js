The course was held in a school inside the city walls of Chiang Mai and was lots of fun. We visited the local market, cooked 7 or so dishes (including the mandatory but always appreciated Pad Thai) and had the very pleasant company of a very international group of folk cooking with us; Swedish (looking glamourous as you\'d expect) / Dutch / French (not the most talkative or friendly sorts but I best not cast aspersions on the national characteristics of Lisette\'s mother Annie) and so on. Funny how the presence of international sorts can have affect your own accent. Quite without meaning to I realised that was going a bit "Gor blimey guv\'nor, I\'m a cockernee sparra" which I attempted to remedy by speaking "proper-like" and ended up sounding like the ba$tard son of Elizabeth II and Dick Van Dyke. Strange. Also had it brought home to me once more that the expressions on my face bear little or no relevance to my actual thoughts. It\'s my fathers fault. I\'ve inherited his cro-magnon / Klingon forehead which lends me a sterner visage than I would otherwise have hoped. I\'m thinking happier thoughts than you imagine I promise! The cooking course was punctuated by many breaks during which the group would eat what we had just prepared and chat. During one of these breaks I observed to the group that it was interesting that with such a diverse collection of souls representing many different cultures that, by and large, all people present spoke English but spoke it with a pronounced American accent. I meant nothing particular by this; just an observation of the influence that America has on the world. However, I can only presume that I was projecting a deep sadness about the end of the British Empire that I certainly did not feel. There was a pause and then the Dutch girl in front of me leaned forward, patted my hand, and assured me that she felt that Britain would "rise again once more". Startled. Does my face secretly proclaim "Oh how I wish England had the Colonies again?" Perhaps. How to rectify? ---'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Something odd: have noticed lots of Japanese girls touring around done up to the nines and with a boyfriend in tow loaded down with photographic equipment.
