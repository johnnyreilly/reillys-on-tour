It should be noted that they dont approach the scarf in the manner of that mighty Doctor Who Tom Baker. No, instead the scarves are wrapped repeatedly round the neck until they resemble a member of that tribe (possibly African but not sure) which extends the length of their necks by wearing multiple metal bands betweeen their shoulders and their chin.

We ordered the local sausage to start and, it being France, we were also presented with a bowl of sliced up baguette as well. Since we had been given the necessary components we decided to take the obvious next step and assemble the ingredients into a very superior hot dog. This is apparently not quite the done thing. The waitress clocked us doing this and her eyebrows shot up to the middle of her forehead and she blasphemed quite audibly.
