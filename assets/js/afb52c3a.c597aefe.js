"Tox", in case you are wondering, is the tag of some London sort who wanders around scribbling his chosen moniker and the year in which it was done pretty much anywhere he can in London. I\'m not sure what he hopes to achieve by adding the year of defacement as a suffix to his tags. I can only assume that he genuinely believes he is an as yet unappreciated talent who\'s work will be toured by future art historians who will take great interest in the "progression" of his work. "Ah yes class, an \'06\' - truly the days when you can start to see Tox stretch himself. Note the positioning of this tag on a busy railway line.
