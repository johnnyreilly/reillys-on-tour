It's not full of big drama - but it is full of the kind of things that happen when you grow up. It made me remember the things that happened to me when I was younger.

Where I lived there were many new houses being built. When the builders would go home for the night onto the building sites my friends and I would romp.

I know my son Benjamin is going to face all this himself - or something like it; his own particular recipe of life. Bad things happen and I can't always be there to protect. I won't have the first clue half the time Benjamin's in danger. I've got to let go - not yet I know (he's only 2) but it'll happen. I know deep down it wouldn't be good even if I could protect him anyway. If I don't let him live his life then he isn't really living life in a meaningful way.
