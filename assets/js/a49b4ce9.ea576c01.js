By warm, I mean 38 degrees Celcius. Classic British understatement really; it was, in point of fact, unconscionably hot.\\n\\nThe wider Reilly family had been landing in Crete in preparation for Dominic\'s wedding to Eleni. Dominic is my cousin, the eldest child of Frances and Jim. Frances is the youngest sister of my mother Ann. To Fran\'s great delight, she is closer in age to me, than to her oldest sister / my mother.\\n\\nDom, who\'s birth I discovered from a note pinned to my bedroom door at university, was due to marry a girl named Eleni who was a Cretan. For clarity, let me say that this is not some sly dig, rather, if you are from Crete, it turns out you are a \\"Cretan\\". As a lady named Cassandra explained \\"yes, we know what it sounds like, but that is what we are\\". I appreciated that they refused to be bowed by any attempt at mockery at their chosen name and effectively said \\"no, this is ours\\".\\n\\nOn Saturday 24th May 2025, a variety of Reillys, Kissells, Kerrs and more had assembled on the Greek island of Crete. All set for the wedding that would unite Greek and UK families.\\n\\nWhenever you have the privilege to attend a wedding of a culture that is not directly your own, it is fascinating. The differences and the similarities clamour for your attention.\\n\\nAs someone born and bred in the UK, the first difference I noticed was the start time. The wedding was set to officially start at 7pm. Back home, 1pm would be more typical. But as we sweated our way through 38 degrees that day, the logic of the start time became undeniable. If it  had started at 1pm, we\'d be passing out in our suits by 1:15.\\n\\nThe entire wedding took place outdoors. Coming from a country where it rains half of the time, and a further quarter of the time it looks like the weather is considering a dowsing, it seemed inconceivable to have an entirely outdoor wedding. And yet that\'s what it was. The service took place in a large courtyard with a chapel in the centre. The reception took place in a garden under the open sky.\\n\\nThe nature of the service was different as well. In the UK, you show up at a church. You sit in a seat and stand and sit as you are directed. You sing some songs. You observe the vows. Typically there will be some kind of address and some prayers. But what is a given, is that all eyes are on the ceremony.\\n\\nIn Crete, it\'s a little different. There\'s a few chairs laid out, but these aren\'t for everyone, more for those who really need to sit. Everyone else stands around at varying distances from the ceremony that is taking place. And there\'s a lot more people. So many that if you\'re further back, you probably don\'t really know what\'s going on. And that appeared to be fine. In fact, for some people it seemed that whilst they were happy to be here for the wedding, paying close attention to the ceremony was not necessarily high on their list of priorities. They weren\'t exactly second screening the wedding; rather it was more like \\"yes there\'s a wedding, but there\'s other things happening too - I haven\'t seen this guy in, oooh, weeks!\\"\\n\\nThe wedding service was conducted in, I assume, Greek. Whatever happened, I didn\'t really understand it. It was, as they say, \\"all Greek to me\\". I think it was a Greek Orthodox wedding, looking at the outfit of the priest and the paintings of icons in the chapel. Dominic is Catholic, and whilst Catholic and Greek Orthodox have differences, there\'s a lot more that unites them rather than divides them.\\n\\nIt wasn\'t just the people there taking in the ceremony that evening. Pat, younger sister to my mother and older sister to Frances, was with us in an online sense. She is a Poor Clare nun, and lives in an enclosed order in England. David, my brother, had kindly dialed her in from her convent in the UK, so she could watch.\\n\\n![A screenshot of Pat watching the wedding on a WhatsApp video call](pat-watching-the-ceremony.jpg)\\n\\nThe priest was a bearded chap, with a full head of hair and an impressive gown. To my great surprise, he appeared to be the older brother from another mother of one of the curates of my own church back in Twickenham. I took the opportunity to let the Anglican priest in England know I\'d encountered his probable relative near Heraklion. He pondered it may actually be him in future, suggesting he has some knowledge of time travel and flexibility in theology which hadn\'t hitherto come through in his sermons.\\n\\nHurling of confetti or rice is something that appears to be shared across the cultures. Towards the end of the ceremony, a large bowl of rice went around the crowd, from which everyone took a handful. Someone said the Greek equivalent of \\"at my signal, unleash hell\\" and the bridal party, who were processing around the table where the service was conducted, began to be pelted with the hard rain of uncooked rice. What started as entertainment to me, mutated into genuine concern. The rice being used was risotto style and the grains were quite circular. I feared if we were using basmati we could have had someone\'s eye out. The priest had wisely decided that the magnificent Bible being used in the ceremony, could do double duty as a makeshift umbrella. Not his first rodeo.\\n\\n![The couple and the priest rounding the table whilst being pelted with rice](hard-rice-rain2.jpg)\\n\\nWith the ceremony complete, the wedding moved into a large garden and the eating and drinking began. Greeks like to eat. I thought I liked to eat, but I now realise I don\'t even feature on the leaderboard. It was explained to us that a flock of sheep, belonging to Eleni\'s family, had been executed and roasted for us that day. We had seen racks of meat roasting in the corner when we first arrived.\\n\\n![Lamb roasting on an open fire](lamb-being-roasted-on-an-open-fire.jpg)\\n\\nSo we ate, sat in the open air. It was dark by now, and we couldn\'t always tell what we were eating. But it was great. We ate more. Then more. Curiously, we hadn\'t eaten any lamb. Unless it was disguised perhaps? But whatever we had eaten, it had been fantastic, and very satisfying. As we sat back and focused on digestion, Jim (Dominic\'s father) approached. \\n\\n\\"Now I just wanted to give you a heads up. We\'ve had the aperitif, and we\'ve had the starters. Next we\'ve the mains, which is Gamopilafo. And after that there\'s the mutton course, of course.\\" We blinked slowly at this news. Jim grinned, nodded and headed off to share the information with other tables. I made a strategic decision to go down a belt buckle at this point in preparation. \\n\\nGamopilafo is also known as \\"Cretan Wedding Rice\\".  It\'s lamb which has been roasted, and rice and pasta which has been cooked in the stock of the lamb, with lemons. It\'s kind of a brothy risotto and it is fantastic. As it arrived we reached down to our reserves of eating space, and tucked in. Gosh it was good. \\n\\n![a photograph of one of the tables at the wedding](wedding-feast.jpg)\\n\\nWe ate what we could, then sat back. Overwhelmed. I was mulling how many belt buckles a man could go down. Much food was subsequently removed from the table. As Jim had predicted, then came the mutton course. I think it was called Antikristo.\\n\\nWe tried a forkful. It was exceptional. Such a shame then that there was no way we could have much more. In the end, we sat there staring at the meat, occasionally stirring and chopping and consuming a mouthful. Each time it was a reminder that a mouthful was too much. We couldn\'t eat more. We felt meat guilt as they belatedly took away plates which must have contained nearly the same amount of meat as they arrived with. \\n\\nWe heard, some days later, that the uneaten food was not wasted, and will have been eaten over the next week or so by the family. I\'m writing this a week later, so I\'d say by now that Eleni\'s family have reached peak lamb, passed through it, and are now making resolutions to never eat lamb again. Well, until the next wedding at least.\\n\\nMain courses out of the way, the wedding turned to dancing. There was a traditional Cretan dancing display lead by a troupe of dancers in costume . It seemed to involve a lot of high kicks and jumps from the most athletic member of the troupe and more sort of \\"bobbing up and down\\" style dancing from the other five members. No doubt I\'m doing them a disservice with that description.\\n\\nTowards the end of their display, everyone was invited onto the dancefloor to do some traditional dances. I think \\"Zorba the Greek\\" may have featured as part of this. Bruce, Kirsty and a variety of other family members headed to the dancefloor to get involved in the action. There was swaying and linking of arms, and also a conga. I would have joined in, but recent back issues meant I had to appreciate from the sidelines instead.\\n\\nThe male members of the family were all gifted traditional Cretan wedding scarves called \\"sarikis\\". If you can imagine the scarf worn by scouts, but rendered as a decorative string vest with tassels, that\'s roughly what they were. If you look at this picture of my father, you can see what I mean. The sarikis had been made by Eleni\'s grandmother.\\n\\n![Dad dressed in a sariki](dad-in-his-sariki.jpg)\\n\\nThe traditional music gradually shifted to more modern music. Well, Abba. It was at this point we became aware that my youngest brother Peter had somehow acquired a microphone.\\n\\nSpeeches, a standard feature of English weddings, appear not to be a feature of Cretan weddings. My mother was slightly forlorn at learning this, counting the speeches as potentially one of the best bits of a wedding. If the speech was good that is.\\n\\nPeter had evidently decided that his role in the wedding was to bring a UK tradition to bear. A noble aspiration. \\"Dominic is a beautiful man, beautiful inside and out...\\" he intoned. So far so good, though he seemed to be going toe to toe with Donald Trump in his love of the word \\"beautiful\\". He continued \\"and Eleni is alright too I guess...\\" \\n\\n\\"Oh Peter! You can\'t insult the bride\\" wailed Mum. The speech continued onwards and featured references to \\"Wise One\\", Peter\'s chosen term of endearment for Dominic\'s mother Frances. The speech meandered for a while; the uncharitable in the audience may have considered that perhaps it hadn\'t been entirely prewritten.\\n\\nPeter, realising perhaps that he was in need of a punchy ending to the speech, opted to sign off in an unexpected fashion. He offered an appreciation of the dancing that we had seen thus far, and that he\'d like to perform his own dance for the bride and groom. It would be great to report that I took the moment to look in their direction and gauge a response. But to honest, it was hard to look away from Peter at this point. Slow motion car crashes are undeniably compelling.\\n\\nThe DJ put on some kind of dance track and Peter, taking the whole dancefloor to himself, proceeded to vibrate with energy as he danced. If the guests weren\'t surprised enough by what was taking place, his regularly dropping in the breakdance move \\"the worm\\", which involved hurling his whole body forwards onto the ground, wriggling and propelling himself back upright, certainly impressed them. By the end of the song the audience applauded wildly.\\n\\nAt the last Greek wedding I\'d attended, I discovered a university friend had a significant alcohol problem.\\nIt seemed almost appropriate at this wedding to discover that my brother Peter was making every effort to appear he may be ploughing a similar furrow. On the upside, Peter seemed to be enjoying it all a lot more than my university friend. Upon reflection, I am drawing an ungenerous parallel.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Peter had clearly had the time of his life. Never one to be bothered by the showbiz saying \\"always leave them wanting more\\", he did further dance displays over the course of the evening. Frances later reported that Dtavros and Yianna \\"loved your energy!!\\"\\n\\nOne final tradition which seems to be shared between the UK and Greece, is the throwing of the bouquet. Late in the evening, Eleni threw her bouquet into the crowd. And, as luck would have it, the best man, Dominic\'s brother Patrick, caught it. He was delighted.  His boyfriend Luke, was perhaps best described as \\"startled\\" as Patrick cackled like a mad thing.\\n\\n![Patrick catching the bouquet](patrick-catches-the-bouquet.png)\\n\\n[Watch the moment Patrick caught the bouquet.](./patrick-catches-the-bouquet.mp4)\\n\\nElsewhere, the younger children were now exhausted. Accustomed to being in bed by 9pm, they now found themselves dressed in suits, stuffed with food and drink, and still awake at 1 in the morning. The wedding was due to run until at least 3am. Our youngest boy James occasionally lay on the ground and gave a thousand yard stare to all around him. At this, parental guilt broke in. Realising this was a once in a lifetime occurrence, neither Lisette or I wanted to leave. But we realised that as responsible parents, we probably should. So, with reluctance, we summoned our taxi. \\n\\nMy parents and Peter and his son Joseph decided to join us in the minivan taking us back. Eight of us sped along the darkened Cretan roads headed back to our hotel. It had been a Cretan night, and a magical night. \\n\\n![a panaroma of the wedding feast](the-wedding-feast-panorama.jpg)"},{"id":"be-ye-here","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/be-ye-here","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2024-08-11-be-ye-here/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-11-be-ye-here/index.md","title":"Be ye here","description":"Working out where to go on holiday has always seemed like slightly hard work.

How do you choose? Do we go to Italy? We\'ve been before. Do we go to France? They\'ll only want us to wear Speedos at the swimming pool. So where shall we go?\\n\\nWe were delighted when we discovered a friend in Belfast, who had recently had a baby, would be up for a visit. A mutual friend of ours, was also planning a trip back to Ireland from where he lives. We\'ve known each other for 25 years now, and have travelled before as a group. Why not get the band back together and spend some time in Ireland this summer? That was the thought, and so the Reilly family made plans.\\n\\nPassage was booked on the Liverpool to Belfast ferry. Grandma Reilly kindly leant her car to the Twickenham Reillys, so that myself, Lisette and the boys could roll Northwards and over the Irish Sea to Ireland.\\n\\nWe were leaving an English summer that was that rarest of things: warm and sunny. The week before we\'d left, Twickenham had been basking in temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius, and I\'d been busy watering the lawn, for fear of the grass going brown. Ireland is known for having weather that\'s a little... less generous. Or, as one of my brothers had been known to say, \\"Remember there\'s a reason most Irish don\'t live in Ireland\\".\\n\\nBut it\'s not so far from England to Ireland. If you look at the globe, Britain is pretty close physically. How different could the weather really be? In my mind, I thought \\"maybe we\'ll drop five degrees - that\'s still pretty good!\\"\\n\\nBut somehow, in the time from leaving the M25 behind us, boarding the ferry in Liverpool, going to sleep and waking up in Belfast, we\'d dropped from a sunny 31 degrees to a rainy 17 degrees. Baffled but optimistic, the Reilly family began their holiday.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe plan was a holiday of two halves. After popping in to meet our friend Una and the baby in Belfast, we\'d head North to base ourselves in Portrush and tour around the top of Ireland for three days. Then we\'d head down to Enniskillen and stay in a big house on Lough Erne with Una, Kelvin, the baby plus our other friend Conor and his boys.\\n\\n![All of us posing for a photo](PXL_20240810_103313096.jpg)\\n\\nWe found ourselves roaming around and visiting sites like the Giant\'s Causeway (or as we came to think of them: the tremendous volcanic hexagons). We stopped the car at the side of the road when we saw people pointing out at the water, and got to see a pod of dolphins playing in the water. We headed to the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge that allows you to sway over to a island covered in birds, which looks out towards the Scottish island of the Mull of Kintyre. I hadn\'t realised just how close to Scotland, Ireland is.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere\'s something inherently exciting about a boat trip. I have always loved the notion of getting away on the water. I would have made a great pirate. We discovered there\'s an island to the North of Ballycastle named Rathlin Island. It\'s a place to see puffins and to walk. It sits only 11 miles from the Scottish island of the Mull of Kintyre.\\n\\nThe closeness to Scotland has meant that both Scotland and Ireland have laid claim to the island over the years. Robert the Bruce hid out there at some point apparently.\\n\\nYou will remember the legend that St. Patrick banished all the snakes from Ireland. Inspired by this, in 1617 the disputing folks in charge used the snake story as a guide to determine belonging. They freed a snake on the island. If it lived, Rathlin was Scots, if it died, Irish. It died.\\n\\nWe discovered a boat would take us over. We booked a trip out from Ballycastle at 10am and a trip back on the 3pm. Demand was high and the boat entirely sold out after we booked our tickets. We were wary of seasickness after a recent traumatic crossing to Jersey, when the boat had heaved up and down, and passengers that had eaten a full English breakfast lived to heartily regret it. That trip has entered Reilly family folklore as \\"the time when daddy swore\\". I had, in my defence, had the fullest of full Englishes that morning.\\n\\nBut whilst the fifty minute trip to Rathlin was boisterous, it wasn\'t too excessive. Once we hit shore, our plan was to:\\n\\n- hike west\\n- feel righteous\\n- see puffins.\\n\\n\x3c!-- --\x3e\\n\\nRathlin, it turns out, has more up and down than you might expect. We set out on the hike imagining we\'d be there and back in no time. But it became clear quickly that progress would be slow. By the time we\'d got to the top of the first hill we were heaving and puffing. Puffing for puffins.\\n\\nWe pushed on, following the road as it weaved westward. Every now and then the \\"puffin bus\\" would ease past us and we\'d have an image of rather more leisurely tourists gazing out of the window at the scenery as they were transported up hill and down dale. To our surprise, the landscape featured a good number of old abandoned cars. Presumably, if a car breaks down, it\'s pretty difficult to get it back up the road and onto the boat to Ireland. So instead, vehicles are left to moulder when they break.\\n\\nPeople often say of English weather, that you can have four seasons in a day. Ireland is that premise on steroids. It\'s entirely possible to experience four seasons in ten minutes. And two of them may well be winter. As we tramped westwards we would take off our jackets and jumpers as we got hot, then put on the jumpers as the wind picked up, then put the coats on and hoods up as the rain kicked in. Then we\'d do it all over again.\\n\\nThat level of variety in the weather is pretty tedious to my mind. But it did make me ponder what the consequences of living in that sort of weather perpetually might be. Irish people are, on average, far friendlier than English. Of course that\'s subjective, but I still think it\'s pretty accurate. I had more casual chats with folk in an afternoon in Ireland than in a month in London. Stereotype it may be, but it doesn\'t mean it isn\'t true.\\n\\nIn the end, we reached the bird centre on the west of the island. By the time we got there it was heading for two o\'clock and it was apparent that we wouldn\'t be able to walk back to the boat on time. No problem, we thought, we can catch the bus back. I approached the driver who had just arrived and asked him if we could buy tickets to get back to the boat. \\"Well now\\", said the driver, \\"I\'m not sure if there\'s space, but be ye here in an hour and we\'ll find out!\\" He seemed very upbeat in his response, but as I parsed his meaning I thought I\'d better seek clarification. \\"So Francis\\" (someone had told me his name was Francis) \\"does that mean we might not get back for the boat?\\" Francis considered for a while and responded \\"hmmmm.. well be ye here in an hour and we\'ll see what happens!\\"\\n\\nThis didn\'t seem like commitment to me, but after a while I concluded that commitment wasn\'t on offer. Given that Francis had given us an opportunity, at the least, we decided the best we could do was take it. There followed an hour where we sought to see puffins through binoculars, and possibly did, but they flew past so quickly it was hard to appreciate the experience a great deal. Also, when the possibility of potential drama is present, it\'s a little tricky to experience the moment. Certainly Benjamin, our oldest, was demonstrating that he\'d inherited his father\'s desire that things go according to plan, and attendant anxiety when they do not, or threaten not too.\\n\\nBen ran up and down at the bus stop wailing \\"we\'re totally screwed..\u2026\\" This did not aid his father\'s anxiety one jot. By the time Francis swung round the corner in the bus, the Reilly family had entered a state of hypertension. The bus loaded up, and was full before the Reillys could board. All seemed lost, and Francis could see the crestfallen expression on our faces.\\n\\n\\"We\'ll find a way\\" he said. And after a certain amount of negotiation, we found ourselves on board, with various Reillys sat on one another and sharing seats. I found myself sat on the floor of the bus, surrounded by legs, but entirely grateful to be on the vehicle. It started swaying its way back to the boat. Every now and then Francis would pause the bus to tell a story, point out where a viking was buried, where Robert the Bruce may have hidden and draw everyone\'s attention to a seal frolicking in the sea. I saw none of this, from my vantage point on the floor.\\n\\nThis was fine. We were going to make it back to Ireland, unlike all those abandoned cars. That was all I needed to know.\\n\\n![Me and the family smiling in a selfie](PXL_20240806_100026594.jpg)"},{"id":"the-faith-and-furious","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/the-faith-and-furious","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2023-07-30-the-faith-and-furious/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-30-the-faith-and-furious/index.md","title":"The Faith and the Furious","description":"It was the start of the summer holidays.

The Reilly family had headed North to the Peak District to go youth hostelling, prior to heading East to Newark for the Focus festival.\\n\\nA good time had been had by all. We\'d been staying in the picturesque and slightly remote village of Hartington. The weather had been typical of British summertime. Which is to say, a combination of not raining whilst looking like it might, actually raining and on occasion, being suspiciously pleasant. One must roll with whatever nature throws at you in this country.\\n\\nThe UK loves a railway. We have many. But we used to have more. Back in the 1960s a man named Dr Beeching wrote an infamous report on the profitability of our forest of railway lines. And as a consequence there was deforestation; many of those railways became ex-railways.\\n\\nDeath can lead to rebirth. Whilst many railways stopped being railways, they left behind them tracks, tunnels and paths that joined up destinations. By and large, these tracks were too small to become roads. So a number became walking paths and cycle tracks. We found a repurposed railway joining Bakewell to near Buxton. And, having rented bikes, rode it from end to end. We whizzed through tunnels, we looked out from viaducts and some of the bolder Reillys even stopped to paddle in chilly waters. There\'s something remarkably freeing about freewheeling along what used to be a railway station platform, imagining what it would have been like as steam trains whooshed into it a hundred years ago.\\n\\nI mentioned Bakewell. It\'s a town famous for creating the Bakewell Pudding and the Bakewell Tart. The pudding is undeniably better, but strangely less well known. I blame Mr Kipling. (The cake guy, not the poet )\\n\\nThe Reillys very much like to try local food. Well, perhaps more accurately, we like to eat. Eating local food is as good a reason as any to eat, and if you look at it just right, it almost feels noble. \\"Support local\\" and all that. So we stopped in Bakewell, visited the famous pudding shop and purchased a number of puddings and tarts to eat by the river. Wildly unhealthy and delightfully enjoyable. Do we really need vegetables when we\'re on holiday? No!\\n\\n![me and thde boys eating bakewell ouddings and tarts](bakewell-puddings-and-tarts.jpeg)\\n\\nBack in Hartington, there was also a possibility to eat some local food. Hartington has a noted cheese shop selling local cheeses. So on the day of our departure from the village, we popped in and Lisette purchased some ginger and mango cheese which she placed in her bag for later.\\n\\nThe plan for the day was to travel to the Crich (pronounced \\"Cryyy-ch\\") Tramway Museum. A thing we have learned about our boys, is that they are reliably fascinated by heavy machinery; cars, trains and the like. The tramway museum is exactly what it sounds like. It\'s a tribute to the age of trams, which has mostly passed in the UK. Buses are just easier to run. But there\'s a kind of magic around trams, and there\'s a lot of enthusiastic people who put a lot of energy (and their free time) into keeping the magic alive. Incidentally, there\'s definitely some kind of Venn diagram of tram enthusiasts and steam train enthusiasts which is almost entirely intersection.\\n\\nCrich is an unusual place. It\'s effectively a model village with tracks laid down on the roads to allow trams to rumble back and forth, transporting grinning visitors around. There\'s old fashioned pubs and tea shops in the village and warehouses full of trams through the ages, telling the story of a now mostly sunsetted form of public transport. The boys loved it. They loved getting their tickets stamped. They loved waving at trams as they went past and waving to people on the street as they sat on the top deck of a tram trundling up the street.\\n\\n![look closely and you\'ll see john reilly on the top deck of a tram](tram.jpeg)\\n\\nThe day was beginning to draw to a close. Before we departed, Lisette remembered she had the cheese in her bag. Knowing that cheese doesn\'t survive long outside of a fridge, we decided to consume it there and then.\\n\\nOur eight year old currently has a brace in his mouth. Well I say a brace. I think technically it\'s an orthodontic plate. But that\'s a bit of a mouthful. (Pun not actually intended, but let\'s appreciate the accidental glory of it for a moment.) Anyway, expensive wire and plastic, intended to push his top teeth forward so they don\'t sit behind his bottom teeth. I had the same thing when I was his age, although funded by the NHS in my case.\\n\\nIt\'s the sort of brace, or plate rather, that has to be removed when eating. So James prepared himself for consumption and Lisette dug through the bag. Finally she unearthed the ginger and mango cheese and the Reilly family sat around a wall next to where the trams trundled past and chowed cheese.\\n\\nWe needed to get on the road to Focus where we\'d be camping. We were just over an hour away from Newark. We packed up Grandma Ann\'s car, which she\'d kindly leant to the Twickenham Reillys, and started travelling. Time passed, different family members drifting off to sleep and then waking up as we accelerated and decelerated. A terrible thing had happened, but as yet no-one in the car had realised it.\\n\\nWe rolled into Newark about 5pm, prepared to start putting up our tent and see our friends. It was at this moment that the most unwelcome sentence rung out in the car: \\"where\'s my brace?\\"\\n\\nIt was James. Having checked around the car, it became apparent that the brace wasn\'t present. After we got through the bitter recriminations and false accusations around who had had it most recently, we got into the fun memory game \\"where did you see it last?\\" A high stakes game with an unsatisfactory conclusion given you\'re never really too sure if you\'ve landed on the right answer. It emerged that James last recalled taking it out of his mouth so he could eat cheese and resting it on the wall. I might add, this was a highly expensive piece of bespoke dental equipment. We\'d blinked heavily when we paid the bill for it.\\n\\nLisette phoned the tramway museum, no-one picked up. It seemed there was nothing to be done. Just carry on. I am, in all honesty, not that great at \\"just carrying on\\". At least not when it comes to large sums of money being left on walls. It\'s one of my flaws.\\n\\nSo here I was at Focus, a Christian festival where people come hoping to connect with God and spend time enjoying the company of their friends and fellow believers. Whilst everyone around me seemed to be doing reasonably well at these noble goals, I was not. I burned with inner fury and frustration.\\n\\nI\'m not a good concealer of my emotions and so when people asked me how I was, I was honest. Pretty grumpy. I spoke to friends older and wiser than me, who reminded me that whilst it was indeed a lamentable situation, James was still happy and well. That mattered a great deal more. They were right. I knew they were right. But I struggled to get to actually feeling that way. I would in time. But I wasn\'t there then.\\n\\nI am a prayer, and I often pray for important things. Really I do. For people who are suffering, for situations that are difficult. For things that really matter. At this moment, my prayers turned to a topic that was smaller and certainly self serving. I prayed for safe recovery of my boy\'s brace. And I encouraged the Christians around me to do likewise. If you ask a Christian to pray for you they kind of have to otherwise it would look terribly bad.\\n\\nThat night I slept badly and woke early. Partly that was down to sleeping in a tent next to a busy road. Partly it was down, no doubt, to the brace situation. I awoke with a plan. I believe in praying, but I also believe in meeting God halfway. If I was going to see the brace again, I figured I would increase my odds if I went to where it might be. In addition, I\'ve found in life, that it\'s worth knowing yourself. I am incapable of \\"being\\". I have to \\"do\\". Sitting and waiting was incomprehensible to me. So I got in the car.\\n\\nI drove for just over an hour, whizzing back from Newark towards the Peak District again. Rumbling into the carpark of the tramway museum before it opened, I took myself to the very much closed door and knocked.\\n\\n\\"Excuse me, is anyone there?\\" A woman opened the door, suspicious of the interloper. I explained the situation, and after looking at me carefully and weighing me up, the lady opened the door and walked me down to the wall in the tramway museum; the cheese eating site. I looked around. I looked along the wall. I walked in ever expanding circles around the wall. Nothing. No brace. The museum lady went to check lost property. Nothing. I looked in the plant pots near the wall, hoping it had fallen in. Again, nothing.\\n\\nI was done. I hadn\'t expected to find it. I hadn\'t found it. I had tried, and I was pleased about that. Not as pleased as if I\'d found it. But I thought I\'d done what I ought to, given the circumstances. I disagree with Yoda on this. There actually is try.\\n\\nIt was time to go back to Focus. I leaned against the wall, sighed and looked down. Staring back at me was that beautiful, revolting thing: my boy\'s brace.\\n\\nVictory! Never has a hideous lump of wire and plastic seemed so glorious.\\n\\n![a brace in john reilly\'s hand](the-plate-recovered.jpeg)"},{"id":"what-would-phileas-fogg-do","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/what-would-phileas-fogg-do","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2022-06-09-what-would-phileas-fogg-do/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-09-what-would-phileas-fogg-do/index.md","title":"What would Phileas Fogg do?","description":"It is June 2022.

COVID hove into view back in early 2020 and radically adjusted all our lives. Part of that was the ability (and ease) of travelling abroad. Like so many, the Reilly family were effectively grounded since then. We have made trips, but we never left England.\\n\\nSo when life started to seem less restrictive, we made plans. We found ourselves camping in a place called Cavallino in Italy. It looks on a map, as if it is near Venice. Looks can be deceiving. It turns out Swindon has better travel links to London than Cavallino has to Venice.\\n\\nHowever, links it has, and links we have used. You can travel from Cavallino on the bus down to Punta Sabbioni and then switch to a boat for the trip into Venice (or rather \\"Venezia\\").\\n\\nThis is the Reilly family on Burano, an island to the north of Venice.\\n\\n![](PXL_20220604_122814832.MP.jpg)\\n\\n![](PXL_20220604_122836113.MP.jpg)\\n\\n![](PXL_20220604_122852808.MP.jpg)\\n\\nHaving left the UK, where pretty much all COVID related mask restrictions were lifted some time ago, it was a surprise to discover that they are still in force in Italy. They\'re due to be relaxed in a week or so. For now though, bus, boat, plane and train travel requires a mask.\\n\\nGenerally I keep myself to myself whilst travelling. That\'s only emphasised when travelling abroad as my linguistic abilities beyond my native English are slight. However, as we bussed our way to Cavallino one day I found myself unable to resist the call to right a wrong.\\n\\nAs we swayed around successive roundabouts, gently swinging from handholds, I realised there was a very harassed looking mother and her young daughter in front of me. The mother was clearly tired. She grasped her daughter tightly to stop her from falling over as the bus variously accelerated and decelerated.\\n\\nNearby, a Venetian teenager was sat in a four seat space on the bus. He was pointedly not wearing a mask, and had carefully distributed his coat and bag on the seats around him. The lady was demonstrably in need and so I asked him in pidgeon Italian to move his things for the lady and her daughter. Rather than leaping to attention as I\'d hoped, he looked at me with disinterest, rolled his eyes and then studiously ignored me.\\n\\nI was surprised. Why wouldn\'t he want to help? And given it was clear that he didn\'t want to help his fellow humans, what to do? What, I asked myself, would Phileas Fogg do?\\n\\nFor those of you unacquainted, Mr Fogg is a fictional character who famously travelled around the world in eighty days. There was a television adaptation of his adventures on the BBC at Christmas. It was a big hit in the Reilly family, meeting each family member in a different way. Lisette remains an ardent fan of David Tennant and so was delighted by his playing the titular role. James was thrilled by the trains in one of the episodes. Benjamin thought the music was \\"ace\\". Everyone was happy; I digress....\\n\\nPhileas would persist, I thought. So I persisted. I\'m quite persistent.\\n\\nAfter some time the youth was eventually persuaded (with a complete lack of grace) to let the mother and daughter sit. Rarely has a human huffed so much. I was entirely unreasonable, in his view. The Venetian Kevin the Teenager then slumped back in his seat and turned up his stereo in what we\'ll consider to be a passive aggressive protest against his new neighbours.\\n\\nAll things considered, I was pleased. I remained gently swinging from the handrail as the bus continued rounding roundabouts.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe campsite we were staying on was named \\"Camping Village Garden Paradiso\\". Unlike your most basic of campsites which can be little more than a field with questionable plumbing, CVGP (as no-one called it) was a vast estate. It boasted not only a beach, but a swimming pool with multiple waterslides, a supermarket and a kind of town square complete with shops, restaurants and a stage where nightly shows would be performed. In addition, there was a resident glassblower from Murano who did daily demonstrations of the art of getting glass really hot, and then shaping it into miniature animals and the like. The campsite even had a \\"feeling spa\\" where it was possible to have \\"emotional showers\\". We never quite plucked up the courage to discover what those were.\\n\\nOur typical parental standard of \\"boys in bed by eight\\" was massively disrupted by the nightly show. Benjamin and James would alternate between watching a multi talented lady named Thea perform on stage and staring glassy eyed at glass getting very hot. Thea, who also lead the swimming pool aqua aerobics in the morning, was a revelation. A one woman Amy Winehouse cover version singer, MC, dancer and director of campsite entertainment. She also appeared to be the doppelganger of a school mum friend Lisette and I knew back in England. Most disconcerting.\\n\\nThe gentle routine of campsite life was disrupted by an unexpected email. Lisette\'s Uncle Yves had died. Uncle Yves was the older brother of Lisette\'s mother. He had lived his whole life in Nantes, in Northern France. Unwell for some years; he moved to live in an assisted care home.\\n\\nAs it must for all us in the end, his time here came to an end. He left behind his wife (and Lisette\'s aunt) Nicole. The email was from Nicole\'s brother Jean-Yves, and said simply that Yves had died and that the funeral would be on June 7th, the Tuesday upcoming.\\n\\nJames can be a very caring boy. He said \\"I\'m sorry your family dies a lot\\" and gave Lisette a cuddle. \\"I\'m sorry too\\" said Lisette. She had sadly lost her mother Annie, Yves little sister, some years earlier. That had been a very difficult time and James remembered the toll it took. It was really touching to see him caring for Lisette.\\n\\nThe holiday then took an unexpected turn. Having previously been quite a relaxing time, it now became akin to a film script. Lisette had to travel from Eastern Italy to Northern France. Not the most straightforward journey at the best of times. This was not the best of times. After the height of the pandemic had kept the majority of people in the same country for some years, there was something of a \\"great unlocking\\" taking place. People realised they could travel, and so were travelling. Airlines were struggling to cope with the increase in demand and were cancelling flights.\\n\\nEasyJet cancelled our flight home from Venice, booking us instead onto a flight that left at 11pm. That wasn\'t doable for us as all the trains would have stopped running by the time we arrived home. So instead we found ourselves cancelling that flight, finding one from the nearby city of Bologna, and planning to travel down to there to make our flight, trailing cancelled hotel reservations in our wake.\\n\\nBut now, it would be me doing that with the boys alone, as Lisette would be on her own Indiana Jones mission to get to Nantes. A day of travel, made up of multiple flights, boats, buses and taxis, awaited her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Reilly lads would be similarly on our own pilgrimage. Catching the dawn bus along to Punta Sabbioni and clambering aboard a boat bound for St Mark\'s Square.\\n\\n![](PXL_20220606_055741005.MP.jpg)\\n\\nWe had a final family breakfast together there, munching on rough sandwiches made of the leftover loaves, charcuterie and cheese we had. Then we had to part.\\n\\nWe caught a water taxi to the bus terminal. (Water taxis are \\\\*ridiculously\\\\* scenic by the way - looking out at the beauty that is Venice... Glorious!) We waited there for the number 5 bus to show itself. Then, after many hugs, and with tears, Lisette got onto the bus and disappeared off to the airport.\\n\\nI won\'t dwell too much on the next 24 hours. Suffice to say, myself and the boys went to Bologna on the train. We stayed in a charming Air BnB called \\"Quattro Gatti\\", or \\"the 4 cats\\" hosted by a delightful man named Filippo. But whilst we were in 31 degrees heat, playing ping pong in the garden, Lisette was staying in a featureless hotel overlooking a Lidl. Then attending a funeral and a burial as it rained.\\n\\nAs Lisette reflected later, she was glad to have gone. But she was sad for what she missed too.\\n\\nI leave you with Benjamin playing a song on the piano at Quattro Gatti. It\'s a song he\'s been writing with his friends with the name of \\"emotional damage\\". He has a flair for the dramatic, our boy.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0v7mnpvg8Pk\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen=\\"\\"></iframe>"},{"id":"happy-mothers-day-lisette","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/happy-mothers-day-lisette","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2022-03-27-happy-mothers-day-lisette/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-27-happy-mothers-day-lisette/index.md","title":"Happy Mother\'s Day Lisette!","description":"My dear Lisette,","date":"2022-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.96,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Reilly","url":"https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly","imageURL":"https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg","key":"johnnyreilly","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Happy Mother\'s Day Lisette!","authors":"johnnyreilly","tags":[],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"slug":"happy-mothers-day-lisette","image":"./dinner-as-a-family-on-lisettes-birthday.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What would Phileas Fogg do?","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/what-would-phileas-fogg-do"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mr Ow Much and the steam engine","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/mr-ow-much-and-steam-engine"}},"content":"My dear Lisette,\\n\\nYou are an amazing mother to the boys.

They don\'t worry about where their next meal is coming from, they don\'t worry about whether they\'ll have clothes. Children shouldn\'t have to worry about such things, and ours don\'t.

They don\'t have phones, they don\'t watch everything on TV that they\'d like, they don\'t go to bed at 10pm. You\'re careful to have children that have what they need, but not what they want. If they had what they wanted, they\'d be less content than they are.\\n\\nYou\'ve created healthy boundaries which make for happier children. The boys wouldn\'t thank you for this now, but I will. Thank you.\\n\\n## Their biggest fan\\n\\nThe boys know that you really dig them. Even if they don\'t always respond in kind, they know that you think they are *amazing*. This builds quiet confidence in them. It means they don\'t have doubt about their tremendousness as human beings. They know they are brilliant as they have a cheering section in you. You want to spend time with them, you enjoy their company and believe that the best possible time you could be having is with them.\\n\\n## Rituals\\n\\nIn your days you\'ve built rituals for them. You start the day with cuddles and stories. We pray as a family before we leave the house and at bedtime. There\'s showers and stories before bed. All of these build happiness within the boys. Humans like rituals. It\'s a basic need we have; it centres us and calms us. You\'ve made good rituals for the boys that make them happy and that connect then with God.\\n\\nYou\'re an amazing mother and your boys are blessed to have you xxx\\n\\n![a photograph taken of the whole family at dinner at Del Posto in St Margarets](dinner-as-a-family-on-lisettes-birthday.jpg)"},{"id":"mr-ow-much-and-steam-engine","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/mr-ow-much-and-steam-engine","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2021-08-01-mr-ow-much-and-steam-engine/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mr-ow-much-and-steam-engine/index.md","title":"Mr Ow Much and the steam engine","description":"The bodies lay upon the ground in the field.

They were very still. After a surprisingly long period of time, the figures started to move slowly. It turns out that yoga in a field can, temporarily, be indistinguishable from death.\\n\\n## Camp Wowo\\n\\nWe were staying at a campsite named Camp Wowo in East Sussex, England. It\'s a campsite I have stayed at many times over the years. Initially just myself and Lisette. More lately, having got past the initial intensity that results from the arrival of children, we\'ve come to taking our boys to camp together as a family.\\n\\nIt\'s never been without incident. The first time, one of my brothers melted the trainers I\'d come wearing next to the bonfire. This left me hobbling around the campsite in shrunken shoes with brittle laces.\\n\\nThe last time we stayed, a friend was in a car crash which they fortunately walked away from. This time our visit coincided with such strong winds that a gazebo lent to us by some friends was lifted, tent pegs and all, out of the ground and into some nearby woods.\\n\\nSo I\'ve come to the conclusion that there is something implicitly risky about Camp Wowo. Perhaps it\'s the yurts.\\n\\nThe boys loved camping. And, as a dad, I loved them, loving camping. My eldest boy is highly influenced by the works of Bear Grylls, and would explain at great length the best way to construct a bonfire. To give him his credit, his bonfires were very good. In the evening, after dark, the boys liked to go for \\"nightwalks\\" which amounted to rambling in the woods without being able to see, occasionally falling in streams. I couldn\'t quite see the joy in it myself, but I was clearly the exception.\\n\\nMyself I found something magical about us waking up in the tent together. Blonde boys with tufty hair, squinting and yawning like baby bears as they opened their eyes for another day of fun. Coming over for cuddles before the day fully kicked into gear.\\n\\n![The boys sat on a bench by the campfire at Camp Wowo](boys-by-campfire.jpg)\\n\\n## A trip to the past\\n\\nOne of the attractions of Wowo is the Bluebell Railway. The Bluebell Railway is what\'s known as a \\"heritage line\\", the trains that run are all historic, and mostly steam engine powered. The boys like trains generally. Steam trains are, naturally, even more exciting. The combination of them being from times gone past, incredibly powerful and noisy, as well as being dangerous, makes them thrilling. They\'re like dinosaurs that aren\u2019t quite extinct. The Bluebell Railway is Jurassic Park.\\n\\n![The boys witnessing a steam engine on the Bluebell Railway](IMG_20210728_160713.jpg)\\n\\nSo a trip to Camp Wowo would be incomplete without a trip on the Bluebell Railway. Sadly the last time we were here, it was fairly early into the COVID 19 pandemic and the Bluebell Railway was closed. The line is mostly staffed by retired volunteers. Given that this demographic was considered high risk, it was unsurprising to discover that the line was out of action for a while.\\n\\nBut this year it was back up and running and we found ourselves at the ticket office happily purchasing a family return to East Grinstead. It seems to be a general trend that prices have risen now that places are starting to reopen, and the BR was no exception as we parted with \xa360 for our tickets. Probably lots of places are trying to make back the money they lost whilst they were closed. It\'s hard to begrudge but also hard on the wallet.\\n\\nOne of the things that is so delightful about heritage lines is that it\'s not just old trains running. All the stations and staff are decorated and dressed as though it was 1933 or thereabouts. The waiting rooms feature adverts from years ago. For day-trips to Brighton, and for ice creams and cigarettes that no longer exist.\\n\\nCuriously a number of cigarettes used to rejoice in variations on the name \\"flake\\". \\"Gold Flake\\" and \\"Dark Flake\\" and similar. I grew up in the UK of the 80s and 90s, where every third advert on television was [a woman in a bath eating a chocolate bar named \\"Cadbury Flake\\" to the strains of \\"only the crumbliest, flakiest chocolate, tastes like chocolate never tasted before\\"](<https://youtu.be/9AATTN5p30A>).\\n\\nSo the idea of a flake being smoked seemed deeply puzzling. I had to keep reminding myself that people would not be eating the cigarettes being advertised. Incidentally, I have vague memories of being able to purchase chocolate cigarettes in the sweet shop when I was very young, which can only have contributed to my confusion. I assume that chocolate cigarettes are no longer being sold. It feels likely that someone at some point will have asked the question \\"are we sending helpful messages to the children of society by making these?\\"\\n\\nWe had wondered if the trains would have been forced to make adjustments to cater for the pandemic as many establishments have been. But as we looked around we realised that very little tweaking was probably required. Steam trains and their rolling stock are either entirely open air, or enclosed carriages. \\"Open-plan\\" was not a strong design influence in the 30s and 40s. As such, each party could generally find themselves an individual compartment where they were safely isolated from the rest of the passengers.\\n\\nThe Reilly family steamed out of Sheffield Park on the first train of the day. We chugged slowly up to East Grinstead, travelling through Horsted Keynes and Kingscote along the way.\\n\\nWhilst it\'s notionally fun to realise you\'re being conveyed by a steam engine, this high passes quite quickly. A compartment is just a moving box; the steam engine is where the action is. Happily, getting to the action is totally achievable. The engineers that run the train are essentially excited seven year olds in seventy year old bodies. They happily showed off the engine to the awe inspired children gathered around, once we\'d pulled into a station. I got to glimpse into the firebox and I have to say it was terrifying. I found myself looking at a large bath of shimmering fiery coal, pushing out a fierce wall of heat. I didn\'t realise I was scared of baths of fire, but it turns out I really am.\\n\\n![Myself and the boys in the cab of a steam engine looking into the firepit feeling suitably awed](IMG_20210728_155439.jpg)\\n\\n## Mr Ow Much and the steam engine\\n\\nOn that particular day I was wearing my \\"Mr Ow Much\\" sweater. It\'s quite a striking outfit as it features an image of a made-up \\"Mr Man\\" character invented for a [song by Ben \u201cExP\u201d Goodwin](<https://youtu.be/aZuiWGC6Pto?t=12>); a hip-hop artist from West Yorkshire. The Mr Man in question is a character who is the very definition of judicious in his expenditure. Or as he says: \\"It\u2019s Yorkshire, I\'m tight\\".\\n\\nAs we wandered up the platform at East Grinstead, the stationmaster stopped me and asked me about my sweater. I explained it wasn\'t a real \\"Mr Man\\" and it was from a song. And that I\'d got the sweater for being one of the people to crowdfund the album that featured it. The stationmaster nodded and looked slightly thoughtful.\\n\\nIn the pause, we asked him how much it was to get into the steam train museum. Without missing a beat, he said \\"\xa330 a head\\". He then grinned and waited for me to retort \\"\'Ow Much?!\\"\\n\\nTragically it turns out that I\'m slow on the uptake and in the awkward silence that ensued he had to explain that this was actually a joke and entrance was included with our train ticket.\\n\\nI profoundly wish this story had a better ending."},{"id":"requiem-in-crossbush","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/requiem-in-crossbush","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2020-03-14-requiem-in-crossbush/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-03-14-requiem-in-crossbush/index.md","title":"Requiem in Crossbush","description":"It was Friday 13th.

Gran had never been keen on that date. So it was ironic, or perhaps appropriate, that date came to be the occasion of her funeral. The universe likes a giggle.\\n\\nAt 10 o\'clock in the morning the family and friends of Averil Bessie Jenkins gathered at the Poor Clare\'s Convent in Crossbush, near Arundel. Home of Sister Pat; aunt to me, sister to my mother and my aunts, daughter of Gran. Averil had been a Jenkins, a Frame and a Luxford over the course of her life. The building was filled with people who had known all three.\\n\\nI\'d travelled down with my sister Kirsty from London that morning by train, where our brother Peter met us at Arundel station. Mum had primed me beforehand and so I found myself clean-shaven, dressed in a black suit, wearing a tie and smart black shoes. It was very unlike me. Mum was delighted. Aunty Frances took a photograph.\\n\\nThe chapel at the Convent had high ceilings and was painted white. Windows high up let light stream into the room. As I stood near the entrance I could see the coffin sat in the centre. It was surrounded by tall candles and draped with flowers. One of the windows in the chapel was etched with memories of Kevin James Frame. Kevin was Gran\'s son. He had died young; at the age of only 20. I\'d never met him; Kevin having died before I was born. I can\'t imagine how painful that must have been for Gran. Aunty Pat would say at the wake later \\"Your mum\'s not supposed to die. She\'s supposed to go on forever.\\" That\'s a sentiment I can dig. I feel it. But what\'s far worse is your child going before you. Having a memory of Kevin etched into the window of the room where we were going to remember Gran, made me feel something. I couldn\'t tell you quite what. Some emotion I can\'t articulate.\\n\\nI was to be a pallbearer. Alongside me were my brother Peter, my cousins Patrick, Dominic and Matthew, alongside my cousin Laura\'s husband Calum. We were arranged in height order and drilled by the undertakers until we understood what we would need to do later on.\\n\\nIt had been a difficult year. Lisette\'s mother Annie died last year. She wasn\'t my mother but I loved her very much. Gran died this month. Likewise I loved her very much. Gran was a constant in my life. I didn\'t see her a great deal. But she\'d always been there. I was missing Annie too. I didn\'t go to her funeral. It took place in Mallorca and someone needed to take care of the boys. I was wearing cufflinks that Annie had given me some years before. I liked having something from Annie with me.\\n\\nI sat in a pew with Aunty Kathleen, Bob and Calum. Behind me were my parents. Bob gave me the order of service. With it came a picture of the farmhouse gran was born in. I knew the picture from having seen it on Gran\'s mantelpiece. Seeing the image brought a rush of vivid emotion.\\n\\nThe chapel is used all day and everyday by the sisters at the Convent. It\'s part of their daily life. They had arranged chairs around the coffin. Aunty Pat sat next to it. The candles were lit.\\n\\nI could hear voices raised in song. As ever, my father\'s louder than most, intoning \\"Be thou my vision\\". I found that I couldn\'t sing without getting choked up. I didn\'t want to sob, so I didn\'t sing either. I became aware of Dad\'s voice dropping away here and there. I wondered if he was similarly afflicted. The emotional Reilly men, perhaps? I put it to Kirsty later. She said \\"No, Dad just stops singing when he can\'t hit the high notes. And because he\'s so loud in the first place you notice his absence\\". So perhaps not.\\n\\nThe funeral was Catholic. My mother\'s side of the family generally are. It\'s not my tradition, but there is much in it I appreciate. The service was taken by Father John, an elderly priest who had in fact married Gran and Grandad some forty years previously. (Gran having lost her first husband, my biological grandfather, when I was a baby.) Father John lead us through the service. There were songs, there were prayers. There was communion.\\n\\nMum and Aunty Frances walked to the front, turned and stood next to the alter, facing the congregation; family, friends and, of course, Aunty Pat\'s fellow sisters at the Convent. Mum and Fran alternated sharing memories of Gran. Telling stories of her life. And their lives. How Gran had met her first husband James Frame, by throwing a bucket of water over him. How Averil was born in a farmhouse and lost her father when she was only eight years old. How, as a grandparent, Gran regularly hosted and cooked roast dinners for twenty to thirty family members. Where large quantities of food would be consumed, and then the family would slowly wander around the farm to help the lunch go down. When Gran\'s first husband died, how she carried the burden of ensuring that Aunty Frances still got to be a child. How Gran had not given up when she lost her son and her husband in quick succession. How she had married Brian Jenkins, the man I have always known as my grandfather, and in many ways started again.\\n\\nFrances read words written by my cousin Tracy, sent over from Canada, recalling childhood memories of staying with Gran. Tracy said \\"Gran wasn\'t very cuddly\\" but then told a story of when she was had become very scared at Gran\'s house and how Gran held her until she wasn\'t. Mum and Fran spoke of many kindnesses. Of many determined acts of love.\\n\\nLife was not always easy for Gran. What was abundantly clear was this: Averil did not do defeat. When life gave her lemons, she quietly made lemonade.\\n\\nMyself and my fellow pallbearers came forward. We bowed towards the alter, then, instructed by the undertakers, lifted the wooden coffin into our hands and then onto our shoulders. It was heavy. Very heavy indeed. Gran was a sturdy lady who had played hockey for Horsham. As her coffin rested upon our shoulders and we shuffled forward there was little doubt of that.\\n\\nGran died at age of ninety. She was at home in bed and was surrounded by her four daughters who loved her greatly. To be surrounded by a family that loves you at the end of your life must be a tremendous comfort. Death is hard. I\'d say that it was made more bearable for my aunts and my mum in that they had each other. We need one another.\\n\\nEmotions are not like they are in films and on television. They\'re not straightforward. It\'s less like a consistent feeling of sadness and more like an ebb and flow. You surf the waves of your mood. And at times of grief, the height of the waves is just that much higher. Or lower. One moment you\'re just fine. The next you\'re feeling highly charged emotion. Maybe you\'re crying. Maybe you\'re delighted. Perhaps you are overwhelmed by a sense of love. All told, there\'s a lot of emotion involved. It\'s tiring. Mr Spock had a point.\\n\\nDirected by the undertakers we carefully manoeuvred the coffin into the hearse and slid it into position. We stood back, massaging our shoulders. For a moment, the sun shone upon us all.\\n\\nEveryone got into their cars and followed the hearse out of the convent grounds. We travelled in convoy to the Catholic church in West Grinstead. Gran was to be buried in the same grave as her son and her first husband James. Next to the grave of Aunty Pat\'s husband Tony.\\n\\nThe hole had already been dug. Across it lay two wooden struts which supported the coffin. Father John lead prayers. Aunty Kathleen stood with Grandad as the struts were taken away and the coffin was lowered to its final resting place. People took turns blessing the coffin using a cut of rosemary that Aunty Pat had harvested from the Convent garden that morning. You could see small purple flowers along the length of the rosemary.\\n\\nThe church bells rang out.\\n\\n---\\nimage: ./funeral-service.jpg\\n\\nThe wake took place in a pub in Henfield. Everyone gathered. And drank. And ate. And talked.\\n\\nThere was a lot of hugging. Whilst Gran may not have been the most cuddly of individuals, her family have taken a different path. I like that we hug. The last time I saw Gran was the Saturday before Christmas last year. Gran couldn\'t move much by then. She was hugged and kissed by many children and grandchildren that day. Although Gran wasn\'t the most expressive of people, I believe she enjoyed it.\\n\\nLaura brought out her phone and showed a gallery of photographs of our family over the last forty years. There were images I hadn\'t forgotten. But that I hadn\'t remembered enough. I\'ve had a wonderful life. Truly. Each picture was full of love and smiles. Happinesses remembered.\\n\\nI felt tremendously grateful. As I looked at the pictures I realised that in each one I represented the youngest generation. I\'m not anymore. When those photographs are taken now, I\'m the grown up in the picture now. I\'m not the child. And one day, God willing, I\'ll be the oldest generation and there\'ll be young faces in the pictures that I haven\'t yet met.\\n\\nThat\'s what I hope."},{"id":"glamping-and-brewing-edited-by-benjamin","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/glamping-and-brewing-edited-by-benjamin","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2019-06-02-glamping-and-brewing-edited-by-benjamin/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-06-02-glamping-and-brewing-edited-by-benjamin/index.md","title":"Glamping and Brewing (edited by Benjamin)","description":"On May 27th 2019 the weather in Peschiera del Garda looked like this:","date":"2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":6.82,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Reilly","url":"https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly","imageURL":"https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg","key":"johnnyreilly","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Glamping and Brewing (edited by Benjamin)","authors":"johnnyreilly","tags":[],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"slug":"glamping-and-brewing-edited-by-benjamin","image":"./IMG-20190529-WA0009.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Requiem in Crossbush","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/requiem-in-crossbush"},"nextItem":{"title":"Elvis At Last","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/elvis-at-last"}},"content":"On May 27th 2019 the weather in Peschiera del Garda looked like this:\\n\\n![](weather-forecast.png)\\n\\nWhilst in Twickenham it was more like this:\\n\\n![](weather-forecast-twickenham.png)\\n\\nSince myself, my good lady Lisette and the marvellous, \\"extreme\\" (that\'s right! - Ben) Benjamin and James were camping in the former location, we collectively agreed it was a bummer.\\n\\nTo be more accurate, we were not so much camping as glamping (correct! - Ben). Whilst we were living under canvas, we had not erected that canvas with the honest sweat of our mutual brows. Rather, we had opted to show up and occupy a tent which had already been pre-assembled for our living pleasure. Even calling it a tent seems a stretch, given that it featured a 4-ring gas stove, a fridge, a microwave, beds, lights, electricity and was sited upon a raised wooden deck rather than muddy earth.\\n\\nBut it didn\'t have a toilet or running water, so we could still argue that on some level we were still \\"getting back to basics\\". This kind of camping also fulfils a basic life-need of mine, that is to say: access to cooking facilities. The absence of stoves means I\'ve always viewed hotels as disempowering experiences. To me at least, not being able to cook is in the same ballpark as being denied the right to vote. Hotels are essentially prisons with a more lenient gate policy.\\n\\n![](IMG_20190526_195626.jpg)\\n\\nIn many ways, this kind of trip harks back to the holidays of my childhood. Apart from the first seven summer breaks of my life, family holidays were spent on a campsite somewhere in Europe. Before that, each August we\'d gone to stay in a chalet in the Gower in South Wales. This particular family ritual was brought to a brutal close due to a tragic brewing accident which I will attribute to my father. As it was his fault.\\n\\nBack then, Dad was a keen brewer of ginger beer. Ginger beer unlike the bottles of Idris you might see in Waitrose. Different. This was potent stuff. Filled with yeast and sugar and (in the end) alcohol. The recipe resulted in a fiery liquid which, as it fermented, pumped out prodigious quantities of gas courtesy of the yeast. Now, this was in the days before plastic bottles. Imagine. A time before David Attenborough documentaries of ecological tragedy. Instead, my father used glass bottles.\\n\\nThe ginger beer-in-waiting was treated much like the Incredible Hulk. Tentatively. Cautiously. Carefully. Each day, past a certain point in the brewing process, someone would be called upon to perform the great gas releasing. What this meant, was taking each bottle in turn and opening it a touch to allow some of the excess gas to escape. Then reclosing each bottle once normal atmospheric pressure had been achieved. It was a delicate task and not unterrifying. The rich reward was the amazing liquid left at the end of the brewing process. A fiery brew which I have not subsequently tasted the like of in my life. It truly was that good.\\n\\nUpon this occasion, in our holiday chalet in the Gower, we were all milling around the lounge. Reading, playing boardgames and suchlike. Suddenly there was an explosion. A fully fledged boom. For a moment there was a fear it could be a minor terrorist incident. It\'s hard to believe now, but it was genuinely a concern at that point in time. Busily active then were Meibion Glynd\u0175r; a Welsh nationalist movement violently opposed to the loss of Welsh culture and language. They were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s. We were staying in one such home.\\n\\nOnce the shock of the moment passed, we went to investigate. It turned out that one of Dad\'s bottles of ginger beer had achieved critical mass and exploded. In fact it had gone off like a rocket, launching from the carpet, climbing, climbing until it reached escape velocity. Punching a jagged hole in the ceiling as it left the chalets atmosphere. Scattered around the room were smashed bottles, shards of glass with droplets of the sticky, fizzing liquid rolling down the walls. Whilst it\'s good no-one was present to witness the event, one can only imagine it was quite a sight. You can see why we weren\'t invited back.\\n\\nI digress. Family holidays after that were, invariably, camping trips to somewhere in Europe. I seem to recall that the first trip split our time between Jard-sur-Mer and Biarritz. Over time we established a pattern of driving, catching a ferry and travelling to either France, Italy or Switzerland. Always camping in pre-erected tents. Generally with Eurocamp. (Still, I understand, a going concern.)\\n\\n![](IMG-20190529-WA0007.jpg)\\n\\nLooking back upon those holidays, some questions come to mind. As I recall, at least in the beginning of those trips, we would take all the food we were going to eat with us. I\'ll say that again as it bears repeating: we transported, from England, all the food we intended to eat in France. All the food.\\n\\nI can\'t think quite why. I think of my parents as game to eat most anything. Perhaps that was not always the case. Or they feared shops didn\'t exist; too much reading of Asterix the Gaul leading to the mistaken belief that the French hunted wild boar for each meal. Who can say?\\n\\nEither way, the first Reilly trip to France was like Matt Damon travelling to Mars. Carefully bringing with us all the supplies necessary to support life. Not knowing quite what might present itself in reality. I\'m certainly aware of a tendency in myself to over prepare and leave nothing to chance. Lisette will occasionally remind me of the time in the Galapagos where I proposed catching a bus to see the bus stop where we would catch a bus in a weeks time. We Reillys can be like that.\\n\\n![](IMG-20190529-WA0009.jpg)\\n\\nI think this is probably something my parents got over. Perhaps they weren\'t willing to initially accept that French people probably did have shops which sold food, but came round to the view after sufficient evidence had been gathered. I picture them upon that first trip after I and my brothers and sister had been dispatched to bed. My father, looking for all the world like Mr Spock with an afro, thoughtfully writing in a journal one evening in Jard:\\n\\n> Day 4: Again today we saw people who are demonstrably not starving. Some perhaps even could be described as... overweight. Fascinating...\\n\\nMy father pauses to consider, sucking his biro. In the meantime, my mother turns to him and says \\"Mark, we keep seeing this sign; \'boulangerie\'. I\'ve been paying careful attention and I think this may be a food shop...\\"\\n\\nWhatever the mechanism, clearly they came around. Certainly I can remember on later trips attending that most excitingly named place: a hypermarket. (Very similar to a supermarket it turned out.)\\n\\nIt is striking to me that the holidays I\'m having now are not that different to the ones I had thirty years ago. Just that now I\'m playing a different role in the family en semble; I\'m the father now. I\'ve been mulling over why we have chosen to have such similar holidays as my parents. In the end I suspect it\'s simple: they were good times and I remember them with happiness. I will certainly do the same when I recall these new holidays in future. We enjoy each other; family, friends and the world around us. We laugh. We eat ice cream. We are together. Content. I feel very fortunate indeed sometimes.\\n\\n![](IMG_20190530_140808_1.jpg)\\n\\nWhilst we seem be retreading an existing path in some senses, Lisette and I have opted not to emulate my childhood in regards food transportation. We have instead been standing in awe inside the various food temples on offer to us. There\'s so much potential for culinary happiness when you\'re surrounded by ingredients. So very many possibilities. You can see why communism didn\'t work out; insufficient varieties of cheese and olive oil.\\n\\n![](IMG-20190529-WA0002.jpg)"},{"id":"elvis-at-last","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/elvis-at-last","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2018-08-31-elvis-at-last/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-08-31-elvis-at-last/index.md","title":"Elvis At Last","description":"The Reillys had set out on their summer holidays.

Benjamin, James and the Reilly parents were going to stay with some friends on a working farm in rural Devon. The farm was proudly carbon-neutral; it generated electricity and had its own water supply. This was a holiday that could only be more middle class if they breastfed the livestock hummus.\\n\\nRather than travel directly from Twickenham to Devon, the family had opted to break up the journey. So it was that on a Wednesday evening the Reillys found themselves outside their Somerset Airbnb and in need of food. Having wheelspun into the driveway, Mr Reilly was driving no further. Instead, the four of them set out on foot to search for dinner.\\n\\nAfter an initial disappointment, involving a delapidated pub with ashtray and bleach issues, technology was consulted. According to Mrs Reilly\'s phone, a 50\'s America style diner could be found just fifteen minutes walk away. Whilst Mrs Reilly had misgivings about the health qualities of burgers, fries and milkshakes, she felt it still represented the best available option.\\n\\nHaving studied the map, the route seemed straightforward. Across a picturesque bridge and then up a long thin farm lane. This ran for a mile or so through fields, finally connecting to the road upon which the diner would be found.\\n\\nThe Reillys turned in a Northerly direction, heading single file across the bridge and onto the lane. It was very basic; just a single track with the occasional passing point. Unsurprisingly there was no pavement, and the lane was gifted a natural ceiling by hedges and trees that had grown out from the sides to meet in the middle. There didn\'t seem to be an intentional trimming policy in place. Rather, the vegetation was only restrained by the occasional tractor punching through and knocking limbs off trees.\\n\\nMr and Mrs Reilly were mindful that it was perfectly possible for a tractor to do the same thing to people. So, when a stile was spotted at the side of the road, they decided to hop it and orienteer across the fields.\\n\\nIt started out very promisingly; Benjamin pointed out delicate white flowers growing in the hedgerows. Sheep were spied gamboling and munching grass nearby. The family continued clambering through woods until the pathway began to descend quite steeply, towards a gap in the bushes. They crept through, expecting to be presented with the promise of food.\\n\\nWhoooosh!!! An articulated lorry thundered past the collective Reilly noses. Thwip! Thwip! Two cars followed in quick succession. Through some error of geography, the family was standing not outside a US period themed eatery but at the side of a very busy multi-laned road. Traffic continued to rumble past at an alarming speed. Benjamin and James stared awestruck as heavy vehicles of all shapes and sizes whizzed past their nostrils.\\n\\nHaving briskly consulted the map, Mr and Mrs Reilly realised they were very close to their destination. Just four hundred metres separated them and sustenance. The family edged up the minimal verge in the direction of the diner. After three hundred and fifty metres everyone came to a halt, confronted with a thick bush that spilled out to the edge of the road blocking their path.\\n\\n\\"What do we do?\\" yelled Mrs Reilly above the noise of a passing juggernaut. Mr Reilly spied that on the other side of the road the verge was clear and unencumbered by greenery.\\n\\n\\"Everybody join hands\\" he bellowed over the continual drone of traffic. \\"We are going to cross the road together.... When I say...\\" Mr Reilly paused for a long time. \\"Ummmm... It is quite a busy road\\" he observed, in case anyone hadn\'t noticed. \\"... Quite soon... Okay. After the white truck.... Go!!!\\" The family, hand in hand ran across the lanes, very aware of vehicles fizzing towards them from 2 directions. \\"Ruuuuuuunnnnnnnn!!!!!!!\\"\\n\\nIt is commonly observed that time can slow in moments of danger and high tension. If the Reillys had last had foot on verge on a Wednesday evening, as far as Mr Reilly was concerned, they arrived at the other side a week Thursday.\\n\\nPanting, the family turned themselves back to face the road once more. In the distance could be seen a building surrounded by 50s memorabilia, Chevrolet cars, neon signs and the unmistakable profile of Elvis Presley adorning the front door.\\n\\nEveryone linked hands again and waited for a gap in the onrushing traffic. Again they had to wait some time. \\"Go, go, go!!!!\\" bellowed Mr Reilly when the time finally came. Eight legs of varying lengths raced across the road, heading directly for the bequiffed blue suede shoes loving icon. \\"Go, go, goooooooo.............!\\"\\n\\nHeaving and shaking, the four figures arrived at the other side of the road and edged up the verge. James could be heard muttering \\"me no like motorway, no like motorway\\". Benjamin was white faced and Mrs Reilly was in the early stages of shock. Meanwhile, Mr Reilly was really questioning the wisdom of whichever authority that had allowed him to parent children. Enacting a human version of the classic computer game Frogger was just further evidence to add to the already teetering pile. Mr Reilly imagined some cosmic authority looking on and shaking it\'s head whilst marking a cross on a clipboard next to his name.\\n\\nOnce they\'d caught their breath, the family made their way into the diner. It was a mighty pleasant meal; albeit just as unhealthy as Mrs Reilly had feared. Throughout dinner there were regularly mutterings from small voices of \\"no like motorway\\" and \\"might have got bashed\\".\\n\\nThe family took a different route back.\\n\\n![](elvis-and-family.jpg)\\n\\n![](family-on-the-beach.jpg)"},{"id":"the-gorgon","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/the-gorgon","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2018-08-09-the-gorgon/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-08-09-the-gorgon/index.md","title":"The Gorgon","description":"As I have grown older, I\'ve become aware of a characteristic of mine, which I don\'t much like.

I have a resting facial expression that gives off a vibe. A hostile one. Not intentionally; it\'s just well... It\'s a thing. My face at rest looks like Vinnie Jones thinking \\"you don\'t get to talk about my mum\\".\\n\\nI get it from my father, who got it from his father, who in turn... All the way back to Cro-Magnon man. Somehow my family line has managed to maintain the same physical characteristics as the European early modern humans of 15,000 years ago, almost without compromise.\\n\\nI used to joke about this with people. Then one afternoon, in a moment of boredom, I decided to google what Cro-Magnon man looked like. You know you get those artists impressions of long dead species? Well the same exists for CMM. Lo and behold, atop the list of my image search results was a gentle portrait of... Well, not to put too fine a point on it, me. I\'m handsome enough, but to all intents and purposes I am also pre-historic man.\\n\\n![](cro-magnon-man.jpg)\\n\\nDaily people say to me \\"are you okay?\\", seeing the foaming torrent of fury upon my brow. What they don\'t realise is, they\'re almost certainly seeing me imagining \\"what will I eat for lunch today?\\" The person asking the question doubtless thinks I\'m giving genuine consideration to eating them. Alas.\\n\\nThis isn\'t helped by a number of other qualities of mine. I have a deepish and booming voice, excellent for terrifying small children... And adults too as it turns out. It all goes together to form the impression of an altogether terrifying man. C\'est moi.\\n\\nTragically for all concerned, the inquiry \\"are you okay?\\" now triggers a Pavlovian reaction. Immediately I\'m thinking \\"oh no\'s! I\'m giving off that vibe again!\\"\\n\\nEven my own wife, who at this point I\'ve known for half my life, asks this question. It\'s as if I have a broken sensor which feeds people the wrong data. My face is the human equivalent of a smoke alarm cited too near a toaster. Daily triggering panic in those around me when really everything is fine. It\'s fresh toast, not the end of the world.\\n\\nWhilst this may seem immediately comic, it is not. Not really. I spend more of my life than I would like attempting to compensate. Trying to make people feel everything\'s okay, when actually everything is okay, it\'s just my face that suggests otherwise. This is tiring. Adjusting the person that you appear to be, to be closer to the person that you actually are. It really is exhausting. It merits a chorus of \\"I am what I am, and what I am, needs no excuses\\". And then some.\\n\\nThe question is: what to do? I need a lifehack to help me. I\'ve had a small bunch of ideas so far:\\n\\nIdea #1. Literally look through rose tinted spectacles if you\'re giving off that vibe. What I mean is: get some sunglasses of a cheery disposition and wear them when you fear you\'re giving off negative vibes. If they look somewhat ridiculous, so much the better. That can only serve your purpose. Aim for Elton John\'s heyday and you can\'t go far wrong.\\n\\nIdea #2: always be looking in mirrors. This has the disadvantage of coming across vain but might help as you\'d be aware of your appearance. It\'s also impractical; mirrors aren\'t everywhere. Mind you, Arthur Fonzarelli managed to swing this.\\n\\nIdea #3: Eye contact; make more of it. This helps people know that you\'re not a serial killer; I\'m certain of that.\\n\\nIf anyone else has any suggestions I would warmly welcome them.

Do you jump up and down emitting a voluble \\"yayyyyyy!!!!\\" because you\'ve just been on a cable car?\\n\\nEvents that should spark joy inside us, and once did, end up being things we don\'t notice. Experiences we should appreciate and feel deep in our gut, no longer provoke wonder. I don\'t think it\'s our fault. It\'s just nature. Familiarity breeds contempt and all that. Or at least boredom.\\n\\nAs we left the runway our on EasyJet flight to Milan, James (who is 3) gazed out of the window of the aeroplane in complete awe. Occasionally turning back to the rest of us to check we\'d noticed that London\'s clouds were now beneath us rather than above, slack jawed by the all out incredible-ness of defying gravity. And quite right too! This is why I dig travelling with the boys; they have the reactions that I used to have. It thrills me to be reminded.\\n\\nAlso, I must admit, there are other advantages to their company. Would I have been invited onto the bridge of a ship if I \\\\**didn\'t*\\\\* have a 5 and 3 year old with me? Probably not. Thanks to a generous Captain, both Benjamin and James got to see the view from the top deck of the craft navigating us from Stresa to Arona across the lake. Not only that, they got to take the helm, steer our noble metal steed and (obvs) parp the horns. All the while, Lisette, Una and the rest of the passengers sat unaware of the junior helmsmen to whom their lives were entrusted. As far as the boys are concerned, life goal = achieved.\\n\\n![](james-steering-ship.jpg)\\n\\n---\\nimage: ./friends-by-the-lake.jpg\\n\\nRevolut is really turning out to have unexpected benefits. For those that don\'t know what it is, Revolut is a debit card. You can top it up on your phone with pounds, and spend those pounds in Euro, Swiss Francs etc without getting a horrendous FX rate. But that\'s not the killer feature. No; the reason you should write home is the little discussed (but all important) feature it offers: embarrassment-reduction.\\n\\nDid you ever go up to the counter in a bar and in your best pidgin Italian utter \\"Uno cappuccino per favore e duo croissants... Uh per favore. Um.... Grazie\\"? Perhaps you use less pleasantries but I find that when you\'ve no idea of the language you\'re speaking, it pays dividends to liberally season your utterances with Ps and Qs. If things have gone well, food and drink will be headed your way. But what comes next? They\'ll tell you what it cost. In Italian. The rotters. You see, I can just about mumble an Italian sentence. Understanding one... That\'s another matter entirely. Neither Conor, Una, Lisette or I have any real Italian to speak of. Non una salsiccia.\\n\\nTraditionally at this point of the transaction I would be squinting hard as I attempted to guess the meaning of \\"quattro euro trentaquattro\\". After 20 seconds of pondering, 10 seconds of frustration, and 5 of desperation I would generally proffer a 20 Euro note and hope that I\'d get change. This works as a strategy in the short term but it has the downside of landing you with more coins than a fruit machine. By the end of a trip I\'m jingling all the way.\\n\\nBut with my handy Revolut card I have a get-out-of-jail-free. Don\'t bother working out what they\'ve said the cost is - give them the card. Don\'t listen attentively, think hard and attempt comprehension of Italiano.... Give them the card! I realise this is weak and isn\'t exactly aiding my personal development... But it is convenient.\\n\\nBy the way, this is exactly how languages die out. Foreign languages, killed by laziness circa 2050. Carry on camping!\\n\\n![](james-sticking-tongue-out.jpg)"},{"id":"sunshine-and-kings","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/sunshine-and-kings","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2017-12-31-sunshine-and-kings/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-12-31-sunshine-and-kings/index.md","title":"Sunshine and Kings","description":"The difference between Spanish winter and British is not really temperature.

If the eyes are the windows of the soul then it follows that I regard sunglasses as harbingers of suspicion. If you won\'t let me look into your eyes then part of my brain is convinced you must be up to no good. Probably only a hop, skip and a jump away from pretensiousness too; that most tragic of attributes.\\n\\nQuite apart from the not-so-nice-judge-y aspect, this is a lamentable attitude for another reason. The thing is, I look quite fabulous in sunglasses. Really I do; Ray-Bans were born to be on my face. Aviators; sitting atop my nose have reached their pinnacle in existence; they can do no better. I base this on memories of me wearing sunglasses when I would have last countenanced it; when I was 20. It might not hold true now I\'m 40. But then, ha! Move over Beverly Hill 90210\'s Luke Perry, there\'s a challenger for the throne.\\n\\nI\'m both a man of integrity and a man with silly ideas. That\'s why I\'m stuck doing my best Mr Magoo. But if there was ever a locale where compromise for eye\'s sake would seem reasonable, it\'s Spain. Each morning I\'ve watched the sun rise over Mallorca; soaring into the sky above Palma old town. Watching the glowing red orb climb until the light is too much. It\'s beautiful.\\n\\n![](Dawn-in-Palma-Old-Town.jpg)\\n\\nBenjamin and James are enamoured of their Christmas presents: toy bendy buses. Plastic and metal approximations of the the sort that used to rumble through London\'s streets, occasionally catching fire. Ah, those bus shaped phoenixes, how we miss them. Galaxy S8\'s are but a lowly tribute act. In one of those peculiar ironies it turns out that all buses in Palma are bendy buses. Consequently the bus drivers of Mallorca are presently being greeted by 2 small blonde haired boys, who enter their vehicles waving petite bendy buses at them as they proceed past in search of window seats.\\n\\n![](James-on-a-bendy-bus-with-a-bendy-bus.jpg)\\n\\nTravel generally (not just bus journeys) is much easier now than it ever was. It\'s all down to the internet. o2 have dropped roaming charges in Europe; you can use data in Mallorca just like you\'re in Margate. (I\'ve never been to Margate but I have to believe it would make me want to use the web.)\\n\\nHaving the internet opens up a lot. We can Google bus routes on our phones and know just when the bendy buses will round the corner. When we\'re on the bus we can see ourselves slowly shuffling along the roads on Google Maps. Oh and my Google phone has this thing where you take a photo, it detects any text in the photo and then translates it (with Google Translate) into English. It\'s incredible! Minority Report has arrived.\\n\\nWith all this in hand, the world is less scary. (Or considerably more so if you\'re into George Orwell.) Travel is so much easier! But we\'ve lost something too. Lisette and I used to get around, get shelter and get fed in foreign lands with no knowledge of language, customs or infrastructure. It felt like such an achievement. Such a noble mountain we had ascended each day. Though if I\'m entirely straight, I\'d say that particular challenge is not one I\'d be up for with 2 children in tow.\\n\\nSo on balance, I\'m really pleased that Google got good at running my life in the last couple of years. I\'d be lost without them. Quite literally. Let\'s hope they don\'t turn evil.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI have this Dickensian ideal of Christmas. I know that the first Christmas happened in a hot country (and more likely in September than December). But I don\'t care. Actual facts be damned. To me, the person who really \\"got\\" Christmas was Charles Dickens. Christmas is supposed to happen in a snow covered London. Where there are snug pubs, mulled wine, minced pies, roasted big birds, carol singing, big Christmas trees, churches, Victorian waifs and strays - this chap called it right! (OK - the child poverty I can live without.)\\n\\nAll this goes to say that the idea of being away from London at Christmas time filled me with deep suspicion. Even dread. Everywhere else is a pale imitation of how Christmas is supposed to be. Christmas happens in London.\\n\\nThat\'s how I felt. I was wrong.\\n\\nChristmas in Palma is different. They celebrate more on Christmas Eve than Christmas Day and if anything the real action is 12th night; January 5th. Epiphany is known as \\"The Arrival of the 3 Kings\\" or just \\"Kings\\". It\'s a tradition that has evolved from the idea of the Magi turning up with gold, frankincense and myrrh for Jesus. (Just what every 2 year old needs, right?) For 200 years, the \\"kings\\" have been arriving annually in Mallorca. In the modern day retelling the kings arrive in Palma by boat (obvs!) They then proceed around the city for 3 km as part of a kind of carnival with music and sweets, passing by palm trees wrapped in fairy lights.\\n\\nChristmas here has Mallorcan ways, food and traditions. It\'s not London but that\'s not a bad thing. Palma has a glory of it\'s own. And no Victorian waifs either... So props!\\n\\n![](Family-in-El-Molinar.jpg)"},{"id":"four-go-to-cornwall","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/four-go-to-cornwall","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2017-08-13-four-go-to-cornwall/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-08-13-four-go-to-cornwall/index.md","title":"Four go to Cornwall","description":"Lisette and I have proven ourselves incapable in the \\"booking holidays\\" category of competence.

This is alas mandatory now Benjamin is in school and restricting our holiday times to select high priced periods. Why did he have to grow up?\\n\\nSo it was, that around 3 weeks prior to us having to explain the meaning of the word \\"staycation\\" to Benjamin and James, we received an offer. A couple we knew from church, Peter and Sarah, were going to be in Portscatho, a village in Cornwall and would we like to stay with them? Would we? Popes / Catholics / bears / woods - you get my drift.\\n\\nWe set our sights for the Southwest. And so, the four of us came to find ourselves winding our way down a single-lane road with the rain lashing the windscreen of our rented car. Always say yes to a memory.\\n\\n![](boys_with_trains.jpg)\\n\\nIn a gesture towards being actual grown up adults we had opted to break up the long journey into manageable chunks. We did this by Air B&B-ing our way to Cornwall. On the first night we stayed with a retired hot air ballonist in Somerset, who was convinced 9/11 was in reality a conspiracy courtesy of the Illuminati. We followed that with a night at the most lovely of farmhouses just inside in the border of Cornwall. It had what few other B&Bs have: a functioning steam railway. James was beside himself with joy; muttering \\"train.... Me... Me! Train! Me! Train. Train!\\"\\n\\n![](James_delighted.jpg)\\n\\nWe had something of a baptism of fire concerning the single lane roads for which Cornwall is famed. I must be ruthlessly honest: unlike Rain Man I am not an excellent driver. So much so that each journey tends to begin like this:\\n\\n\\n<dl><dt>Me:</dt><dd>Dear God, please don\'t let me kill these lovely people and if you could get us where we\'re hoping to go safely that would be oh so greatly appreciated. Thanks. </dd><dt>James (from the back, in a muffled but distinct voice):</dt><dd>Not God! Oh my gosh! Oh gosh!</dd></dl>\\n\\n\\nJames is very hot on outlawing perceived blasphemy these days.\\n\\nSo finding myself front bumper to front bumper with a Land Rover, on a road without passing space, jolted me somewhat from my happy place. During the tense standoff with the other car, I pondered whether car technology had moved on significantly since I\'d last checked. There\'s an awful lot talked about driverless cars and drones these days. Perhaps there was a \\"flight mode\\" for our Vauxhall Insignia that I had hitherto not noticed? I inspected the dashboard optimistically, searching for a button I hadn\'t yet pushed. The other vehicle eventually tired of my misguided wonderings. It reversed to a passing point. We edged past it and onwards to glory. And Portscatho.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPortscatho is a beautiful village on the the East coast of the Roseland Peninsula. It slants down a hill which means at almost any position you can look out to sea. And being East facing, the sun rises above the bay each morning, looking for all the world like a megawatt-bulb Zeppelin. The village contains a pub, a butcher, a couple of shops and the harbour club which doubles as the local cinema on Monday nights. The small harbour is populated with motorboats sat just inside a stone quay which juts out into the sea. Children can occasionally be found hurling themselves off the end of the quay, enacting a worrying local tradition. Apparently it\'s safe as long as there\'s no more than 4 flagstones depth to jump. More than that and legs might be broken. Ah tradition!\\n\\n![](the-coast.jpg)\\n\\nThe water is crystal clear and you\'re likely to find people crabbing. \ud83e\udd80 Crabbing involves using some bait, typically bacon, to tempt in shrimp and crabs to nets. On the first night Sarah took us on a tour and we met some boys doing just that. No friends of caution, they\'d opted for a full rasher of bacon in their net. They no doubt figured that if you scaled up the bait, you scaled up the prize. They were hoping to land Godzilla. Alas life doesn\'t work like that and they had thus far acquired a single (rather puny) shrimp. But we admired their intentions.\\n\\n![](ben-and-me.jpg)\\n\\nThe third personality we were living with was Peter and Sarah\'s dog: Jess. Jess is a giant black walking carpet of friendliness. An enthusiastic and affectionate labradoodle with breath that, post-breakfast, could stun an ox. She\'s awesome and, with a little coaxing, enabled the boys to get past their fear of dogs.\\n\\nOne evening Peter and Sarah were out for dinner. I volunteered to take Jess for her pre-bed constitutional so their evening could go with more of a swing. I should say now that whilst I\'m a dog lover, I\'m not a dog owner. We headed down to the Lugger (your guess is as good as mine - it\'s a road that overlooks the quay). There Jess wandered from bench to telephone box to grassy area, sniffing, panting and occasionally urinating. What felt like the appropriate period of time passed, and I reattached the lead and pointed her homewards. We mooched past our car, which I had parked in a temporary waiting spot. By Portscatho standards, where every second car is double parked or sat on double yellows this seemed small beer. But still I thought I should do something about it. It was then I realised that Jess was busy voiding her bowels on the driveway next to the car. It was dark. And I had no bags. After a moment\'s guilty squinting at the dark (and now smelly) driveway, I affected nonchalance and, with lead in hand, strode purposefully upwards to where we were staying. I awoke the next morning with this mantra running through my head:\\n\\nMove the car, move the dog poo, move the car, move the dog poo. Almost meditative. I might have it engraved on a plaque. Once I\'d summoned energy for the day, I did, and I did. Anyone who was near the harbour at 6am that morning, may have witnessed a man furtively foraging in a driveway; attempting to retrieve something whilst desperately trying not to wake the occupants of the house. Such witnesses would have quickly realised that the driveway being made of super-audible gravel really worked against his noble aims.\\n\\n![](James_tongue.jpg)\\n\\nWalking distance from Portscatho is Porthcurnick Beach. It\'s a glorious stretch of sand to which we dragged 2 bags, buckets and spades, and a buggy. We arranged ourselves on Lisette\'s picnic rug, pretty much immediately resigning ourselves to it being persistently covered in sand. Different people have varying expectations of a beach trip. Just along from our modest pitch a family had erected a tent. The entrance of the tent was expanded out on each side by windbreakers taking the form of walls leading out from the tent to the sea. At the end of the windbreakers a tennis court had been etched into the sand where 2 of the party were gently thwacking a ball to each other. Applying for planning permission was undoubtedly their next logical step.\\n\\n![](ben-digging.jpg)\\n\\nThe beach is well known for a beach side caf\xe9 called \\"The Hidden Hut\\". There\'s been articles in magazines and papers about it. And once someone off of the telly ate there. Or something. Either way, it\'s popular. Having eaten there a couple of times, we can say it deserves its reputation. The prices are very \\"London\\" though. Also, when rain kicks in (as alas it was wont to do on a regular basis) you can really find yourself wishing for a roof to shelter under.\\n\\nIn that wonderful way that children have, Benjamin and James almost instantly made friends with an assortment of other like-minded spade wavers down by the seafront. Negotiating amongst each other what should be constructed next and how. Much digging was done and many moats and castles were made. If I close my eyes I can still see Benjamin standing facing the shore, laughing as the waves hit his back. Magical.\\n\\n![](at_the_beach.jpg)"},{"id":"fathers-day-advice","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/fathers-day-advice","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2017-06-16-fathers-day-advice/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-06-16-fathers-day-advice/index.md","title":"Father\'s Day Advice","description":"When I was 16 years old, my father gave me a piece of advice that dramatically changed me.

His advice changed my interactions with the world. I rather doubt he thought it would have such impact, but change me it did.\\n\\nHaving finished my mandatory schooling, I had recently started attending sixth form college. I was taking A-levels in Maths, Computer Science and Economics. I found I took to the former 2 subjects like a duck to water. They weren\'t a struggle, they were interesting and I had a natural aptitude. For want of a better phrase, I could \\"do it\\".\\n\\nHowever, Economics was a different kettle of fish. It did not fit in my head. I could not grok it. I sat there, in lesson after lesson, listening hard to Terri Wilcox explaining Keynes, Monetarism, supply and demand. Occasionally she deviated and talked about her beloved Blackburn Rovers. It did not go in. Not the Economics and certainly not the football. At the end of each sentence uttered I found myself more bewildered than the last.\\n\\nWhat made it worse was that I was alone in this. We all sat there in this silent classroom. Everyone else drinking in the new knowledge like so much ginger beer. Except me.\\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks I began to despair. I was learning nothing. I felt I was about as likely to gain a qualification in economics as I was to learn how to breathe underwater. (A life goal that I had only recently realised wasn\'t actually possible.) So, whilst drying up after dinner one night, I explained my predicament to Dad.\\n\\n\\"If you don\'t understand something, you should ask\\" he advised.\\n\\n\\"But I\'ll just look stupid\\"\\n\\n\\"No, if don\'t ask then you\'ll remain ignorant. And that is stupid.\\"\\n\\n\\"But no-one else needs to ask, they all understand!\\" I moaned.\\n\\n\\"How do you know?\\"\\n\\n\\"Well if they didn\'t, they\'d ask.\\"\\n\\n\\"Like you, you mean?\\"\\n\\nThe man had a point. He continued:\\n\\n\\"I reckon that every person in that room is in the same position as you. I reckon they\'re all sitting there saying nothing and learning nothing. That\'s what I think. And even if I\'m wrong, you\'re certainly learning nothing right now. You have an opportunity to change that.\\"\\n\\nI couldn\'t fault his logic. I was slightly concerned about where it might lead, but there was a chance he was right.\\n\\nIn the next dreaded lesson I sat there listening. Terri was talking about the money supply or some such fanciful notion. As usual, in the realm of economic education, I was demonstrating all the sponge-like qualities of a pumice stone. Terri reached the end of her spiel and said \\"Any questions?\\"\\n\\nSummoning my courage I raised my hand and said \\"I don\'t think I quite understand...\\"\\n\\n\\"What don\'t you understand?\\"\\n\\n\\"Well... Any of it really.\\" There were were titters, as I had feared. Terri paused for a moment and then grinned. She proceeded to start explaining at the beginning. At the end of each paragraph she would check with me that I was following along. I\'d respond, honestly, and where I didn\'t follow it, Terri would take me through, concept by concept until I did. From my perspective my classmates might as well not have been there; it had turned into a dialogue between Terri and myself. When it came time to leave the lesson I had a first: I\'d learned something.\\n\\nThat\'s how it continued from thereon in. If I didn\'t understand something, which was most of the time, I asked. Terri stopped and she took me through it. I **never** came to find the dismal science straightforward or interesting. It is dull. But I did learn it. In large part I credit that to Terri for being game with a student who showed no gifting for her subject. But mainly I credit this to my father.\\n\\nThe principle he espoused applies far more broadly than A-level economics lessons. If you don\'t know: then you should say. Find out! You\'re wasting your time otherwise. The only reason other people don\'t do the same is that they\'re scared. But scared of what? Looking ignorant? That passes in a couple of minutes. Actually being ignorant doesn\'t.... Unless you take action. It\'s a lesson that\'s stuck with me.

I loved it; for my money it\'s a wonderful film. Albeit one with a terrible name. I put it to you my alternative title is better... Ish.\\n\\n![](Trainspotting-2.jpg)\\n\\nI went to see the original in the cinema. Like pretty much anyone of my generation I had the mandatory orange posters plastered on my walls. I read the book multiple times. I had the video, the VHS cassette (I\'m that old). Hell, I had the green special edition VHS with the deleted scenes. (Which was probably only released because at that time the marketing men realised they could slap Trainspotting on \\\\**anything*\\\\* and make some money.) If I was going out for a night I watched Trainspotting with a drink in my hand before I headed out. It was part of the vague rituals of my life.\\n\\nThe film meant a lot to me. It\'s hard to express just why; excessive exposure has tattooed it into my mind. Part of it may be that the characters feel real. I have the same reaction to the Before Sunrise / Before Sunset characters Jesse and Celine and they\'re quite different but equally distinct.\\n\\nI had some trepidation knowing that they were making a sequel to Trainspotting. Sequels usually fail to honour the original. But I\'ve got a lot of time for Danny Boyle and I thought it could work out. In Danny We Trust. Rightly so.\\n\\nIt\'s not the same sort of film as the original. The nominal plot is not what the film is about (which is as well as the plot is fairly unedifying). The film is about getting older. Aging. How do you feel about how your life has turned out? How do you feel about the relationships in your life? Your family? Your friends. How are you doing?\\n\\nIt got me at a gut level. I have a feeling I responded to it so much because I\'m not the same age as the me that originally imbibed this. Time has passed. I see these faces up on the screen and in the same way they\'ve got creases in their faces and lines around their eyes, so do I. George Orwell said: \\"at 50, everyone has the face he deserves\\". The idea being that by the time you reach that age the movements of your face, the smiles and the frowns will have become etched in stone. Recorded in your skin as the permanent expression of the memory of a million emotions. So get smiling or I\'ll know you haven\'t been.\\n\\nThe characters, those that survived the original, are all back and you believe it\'s them. It\'s not some actors turning up for a paycheck; it\'s totally them. It\'s Mark Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and the supremely terrifying Begbie. The latter member is, somehow, one of the most fear inducing characters committed to celluloid. At any given moment he could do \\\\**anything*\\\\*. You have absolutely no idea what he will do. Then he does it.\\n\\nIf you had any time for the original I think you should take a look at this. It\'s wonderful. It\'s hideous and filthy in large part and yet it is fulfilling and somehow... Elegiac. The best part for me is what happens to Spud. I won\'t spoil it - but there\'s a great idea that is used for his character.

Over the course of the movie, they travel to different places in North America, spend time with different groups of friends and family. In the end, (spoiler alert) they work out where they think they should be.\\n\\nWhen Lisette and I first saw it we thought it was fantastic. It\'s got a great soundtrack. It\'s got John Krasinski, making me question my own sexuality and reinforcing Lisette\'s. It has beautiful locations. It has great characters. What\'s not to love?\\n\\nWhen we first watched it, the main theme of the film was just incidental to us. \\"Where should we live?\\" That\'s the question. Where should we be now? Where should we raise our children? Where do we belong? Over recent years this theme has become something Lisette and I actively think about.\\n\\n## Never Let Me Go\\n\\nWe live in leafy Twickenham on the outskirts of London. We have done for more than a decade. As we\'ve lived here we made many good friends and we\'ve had wonderful times. There was a beautiful period when our first son was born where it felt that every person we\'d see on the street would be someone we knew well and loved.\\n\\nBut a serpent entered our garden idyll: people started to leave. One by one we started to notice friends and family upping sticks and moving away. Some would like a bigger house. Alas, unless you\'re an oligarch, that\'s a somewhat difficult proposition in London. Some want to be nearer family. Some don\'t like the city. Some have dreams of living abroad. Or perhaps their work sends them away. They all had and have *REASONS*.\\n\\nThe leavers (let\'s call them that) are \\\\**still*\\\\* your family, \\\\**still*\\\\* your friends. But they\'re not part of your life in the same way anymore. You have different lives, different reference points, different experiences. Those differences make a... well like it or not (and naturally I do not), they do make a difference. So the realisation has started to sink in that a period of life I\'d naively thought would last forever is ending. Has it already ended? Who knows; it\'s all a bit nebulous.\\n\\n## How Did We Get Here?\\n\\nI was born in the maritime city of Bristol, as was my brother. At the grand old age of 3, our family left the Southwest. We moved East to Fleet; a commuter town an hour away from London on the train.\\n\\nMost people I\'ve met look back with unalloyed fondness on the area they grew up. Lisette, a Geordie to her fingertips, is no exception. \\"Wey aye, man, Newcassel\'s purely belta like!\\" she says. Or some such incomprehensible positivity like that.\\n\\n[Fleet regularly tops polls of the best place to live in England](<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30560011>). I ought to love it. I had friends. I had a decent education. It was a green and pleasant land and there was plenty of space. But alas, I\'m a contrararian.\\n\\nAs I grew up I found Fleet to be tremendously boring. The number of times Public Enemy toured Fleet? 0. This is a place that struggled to pick up Channel 4; never mind Channel 5. In fact, the cultural highlight of my youth was one of the world\'s strongest men coming to pull a coach the length of Fleet High Street to celebrate the opening of a pizza shop. So you can see why I left.\\n\\nOddly I never felt like I belonged there. I grew up with a personal Jiminy Cricket sat on my shoulder telling me \\"you\'re not supposed to be here...\\"\\n\\nAfter university I decided to head to London to seek my fortune. The streets are paved with gold, right? Lacking any real knowledge of the capital I aimed my vessel to the home of David Bowie, Mike Skinner and Delbert Wilkins. Brixton. Being one of the rare white faces in the many splendid diaspora of Lambeth I naturally felt completely at home. My flat was in stabbing distance of Brixton Academy as well as the glory of Electric Avenue, Coldharbour Lane (where actual stabbings took place) and the Ritzy Cinema. Each night the town\'s character changed; morphing based on the fan demographics of whoever was performing at the Academy that night.\\n\\nIn a way that defies easy explanation I felt like I belonged. My now wife, Lisette, felt otherwise. Having been raised in Whitley Bay, a seaside town near Newcastle she didn\'t warm to London. But we loved each other, so the deal was we\'d find somewhere that was London but didn\'t feel like it. That was Twickenham. And it was great. It \\\\**is*\\\\* great.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nDo a thought experiment with me: close your eyes and imagine all the people you know in your community. They matter to you. You love them, don\'t you? Now imagine they\'re all gone. One way or another, they have left. Do you still want to live there? Is \\"home\\" still your home?\\n\\nI ask as it seems the inevitable conclusion of this drip-drip exodus.\\n\\nLondon feels like home. In London the air is electric. To me these are both truths. But the other thing to bear in mind is that London is a very transitional place. People come and people go. Often. That\'s one of the things that makes it so exciting. So dynamic. And that\'s why, in the words of Johnny Cash channeling Trent Reznor, [everyone I know goes away in the end](<https://youtu.be/vt1Pwfnh5pc>).\\n\\nThat\'s not true of the suburbs. People settle there. They stay. I have friends living in and around Fleet that have been there since I was a boy. My parents are still there. There\'s something in that stability. Whilst I didn\'t appreciate it at the time, perhaps I benefited from that as I was growing up. It\'s worth considering.\\n\\n## Should I Stay Or Should I Go Now?\\n\\nI feel like I\'m approaching a fork in the road. And on present evidence I\'m liable to go straight.\\n\\nI just don\'t know what to do with myself. With my family. Do we double down and stay where we are? Knowing that the majority of the relationships we form will have something of a time limit associated with them. Knowing that we\'ll regularly need to recommit to making new friends as old ones move on. Who\'s worth investing in? It seems terribly transactional.\\n\\nOr maybe we should be thinking about moving out of the city. Back to where I was raised? Close to family. Nearer to old friends. Longer lasting relationships but less excitement. More space for the children but less vibrancy. Less difference.\\n\\nOr something else entirely. Maybe abroad. Brexit is likely to restrict Brits\' ability to work in the EU. But I\'ve got an ace up my sleeve. Despite being born and raised in England, I find I\'m eligible for an Irish passport purely by dint of my family. My wife is eligible for a French passport in the same way. What glorious mongrels we are. Maybe if we went abroad for work things would become a little clearer in my mind. It helps that I\'m a software developer. You can do that anywhere. And, in fact, even working remotely is a pretty common way of working in my industry. So there\'s options.\\n\\nWhat I lack is clarity. I pray I would know what to do. And when. And why. It comes down to this: I don\'t want to go. Or do I? And if I do, well where?\\n\\n![](away_we_go.jpg)"},{"id":"the-first-day-of-school","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/the-first-day-of-school","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2016-09-16-the-first-day-of-school/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-09-16-the-first-day-of-school/index.md","title":"The First Day of School","description":"It was a warm Thursday morning.

Despite it being mid-September and the beginning of autumn it still felt summery. Just another day of sunshine.\\n\\nBut that wasn\'t quite true, for today was Benjamin\'s first day of school. He was going to get up, eat breakfast, put on a shirt, shorts and a tie and walk the 6 doors down the road to St Stephen\'s Primary. Lisette had reservations about the tie; the shirt too for that matter. It seemed excessive for a child as young as 4. But they were the rules. She had other things to worry about; John was faintly baffled by the level of stress accorded to the difficulty in acquiring shorts. But there you go.\\n\\nThe morning began as most mornings did. Lisette drank a mug of tea upstairs. The boys drank milk, played and sat around her. Downstairs, Radio 4 could be heard in the background as John flicked various knobs and twisted dials on his coffee machine until something was produced that sat somewhere on the scale between \\"cappuccino\\" and \\"latte\\". There was something deeply satisfying to him about the level of effort required to produce coffee. The idea that the varying levels of attention to detail meant you could either produce a gloriously flavoured treacle or, alas more likely, a mug of brown slop.\\n\\nThis was a milestone morning. Everybody knew it was a milestone morning. Something big was going to happen come 8:40. The odd thing about the imminent approach of significant moments is not knowing how you\'re supposed to feel or behave. There\'s a notion that there is a certain path you should be treading but no idea of what that might actually be. So instead, for want of anything else, the morning continued as it might normally. James still wandered off mid-cereal to find his scuttlebug, only tempted back when he heard the \\"pop\\" of the toaster. Benjamin still insisted on 2 bowls for different types of cereal; the majority of which remain uneaten. He also decided that he needed to have porridge to which he gave a similar level of inattention.\\n\\nBut imperceptibly a point was reached. The countdown clock had started ticking. Benjamin needed to be togged up in his uniform, pictures needed to be taken. It was time; the boy needed to go to school.\\n\\n![](BenjaminAndLisetteLeavingForSchool.jpg)\\n\\nThe bell was rung. John watched Benjamin walk into his classroom and take his seat on the floor. His back was to his father and Benjamin formed part of a haphazard circle of 4 year olds. In a difficult to describe way, it felt to John as though Benjamin had just left his family. Left his pack, to be part of another pack. Of course he would see him again that evening. But in a way he wouldn\'t. He\'d see a subtly different Benjamin, with the beginnings of new experiences and loyalties and friends. John\'s eyes grew hot and he forced himself to stare at the wall for a minute or two until he felt more in control of his emotions. Behind him he could hear Hazel exclaiming to Lisette \\"you\'re tearing up!\\" At least we\'re in the same boat.\\n\\nMeanwhile, James had decided that by not going into the class he was clearly missing out. He lay face down on the playground. Lisette felt rather the same way although for different reasons. Normally on a Thursday it would have been her day to spend time with Benjamin and James. Her little gang. They would have gone to Little Acorns to see friends, then to Marble Hill Park to run around and eat lunch in the enclosure. Then maybe to the 1 o\'clock club. But that wouldn\'t happen anymore. Her little buddy was gone. He had moved on and she wasn\'t ready to. Being a mother was, to quote Gilly Charkham, \\"a wrench\\". That night it rained heavily and thundered. It seemed somewhat appropriate.\\n\\n![](BenjaminAtSchool.jpg)"},{"id":"an-overreaction-to-bermuda-shorts","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/an-overreaction-to-bermuda-shorts","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2016-06-25-an-overreaction-to-bermuda-shorts/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-06-25-an-overreaction-to-bermuda-shorts/index.md","title":"An Overreaction to Bermuda Shorts","description":"It is a truism that there are holidays it is a pleasure to go on and holidays that make you appreciate home.

We piled misjudgement upon unbelievably bad weather upon sickness upon unavailable taxis until we made manifest a teetering blancmange of calamity.\\n\\nThe whole journey was planned in order that Benjamin and James might meet their Great Uncle Yves and their Great Aunt Nicole. I\'m happy to report this was achieved. There was a gathering of 3 generations of Priou, all in the same room at the same time and enjoying one another\'s company.\\n\\n![](BermudaShortsDanger.jpg)\\n\\nThe rumours that the French had outlawed Bermuda Shorts seemed unlikely to have any basis in fact. I mean, it\'s a joke, right? Outlawing tasteless yet comfortable summer legwear. No. They really \\\\*really\\\\* mean it. They revile Bermuda Shorts. For why, for why? It\'s surely an irrational hatred, no?\\n\\nIn response, in a rare moment of weakness, I yielded. I purchased one of the (to me) offensive, yet (to the country of France) curiously approved of, items of swimwear. The sort in which no-one, save an Olympic swimmer, actually looks good. Mercifully I was then struck down with a vicious cold that incapacitated me and forced me to lie in a darkened room for several days, thus preventing me taking my plans any further. I feel the universe was staging an intervention. Quite right too.\\n\\n---\\nimage: ./BermudaShortsDanger.jpg\\n\\nI can\'t say why but at moments of linguistic failure I am filled with a profound certainty that everyone can speak English if they just reach deep within themselves and try. Alas, disappointingly often, the bounders disabuse me of this notion.\\n\\nMy approach when abroad has rarely, to my shame, been learning the language. I find I can generally get by knowing the numbers 1-10, please, thank you, hello and goodbye. For any more complicated transactions I tend to adopt the manner of a slightly well-to-do and, importantly, pathetic Englishman. I\'m shooting for somewhere between John le Mesurier and PG Wodehouse. I attempt to radiate the air of a hapless fellow abroad and out of his depth. In short, the sort that people would take great pleasure in assisting. I\'ll be the first to admit to mixed results on this front; yet I press on regardless.\\n\\nThis was never more obvious then when I encountered an older French man as I was lugging shopping bags of sustenance back from the delightful La Bernerie-en-Retz. 20 minutes after my initial encounter, this 80 year old fellow was still regaling me with hearty tales of love, lust and life. Probably. In all honesty he may have been telling me that galettes just aren\'t up to much these days. At any rate there was a great deal of nodding, pointing, handshaking and belly laughing as I tried (and failed) to extract a mere word of English. I have not the first clue what we discussed. But it was **awesome**.\\n\\n---\\nimage: ./BermudaShortsDanger.jpg\\n\\nMy mother-in-law (who is French) moved from Nantes to Newcastle back in the 70\'s. (You may be aware that it is from Newcastle that Lisette hails. She occasionally hints at this.) Anyway, Annie went through something of a culture acclimatisation as part of her arrival in Geordieland (\\"God\'s own country\\"). She tells the tale of when she was feeling low and homesick. She happened upon a Gregg\'s, an institution which you might imagine would not lift the spirits any further. However on this occasion it offered A New Hope. Pain au Chocolat! That greasy mix of pastry and chocolate which is a comfort on a dark day. She wasted no time in \\"pain\\"-ing herself up. And as she reached that fatty salvation to her lips she made an important discovery: in a certain light what may appear to be pain au chocolat will emerge to be a sausage roll.\\n\\nThe principle remains important: pain au chocolat rocks. It also tastes discernibly different to stuff acquirable in the UK. So I made the choice: if ever it is available then that\'s what I\'m having. Lisette meanwhile is deeply concerned with the boys only ingesting \\"proper food\\". That means sandwiches. Well I don\'t agree: bugger sandwiches, say I.\\n\\nConsequently, lunchtimes have been a deceptive affair. Commonly the boys \\"share\\" a sandwich. (Benjamin has the sandwich and is pursued by an aggravated and motivated James who shakes his brother down for scraps.) In the meantime I wait until they\'ve raced past me but not yet turned back round again in order that I can grab a fistful of sweet chocolatey pastry and swing it gobwards. Ah the glamour.\\n\\nOur own judgement on this holiday has frequently been off. I have been pretty horribly ill. The rain has been biblical. However, for the last 2 days the sun actually shone. We ate about 7 pints of moules frite. It felt like a holiday at last! Even if that welcome sunshine hadn\'t come calling we would have been worth it for this:\\n\\n![](Priou-Family.jpg)"},{"id":"so-benjamin-how-do-you-feel","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/so-benjamin-how-do-you-feel","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2016-03-10-so-benjamin-how-do-you-feel/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-03-10-so-benjamin-how-do-you-feel/index.md","title":"So Benjamin, How do you Feel?","description":"Miss Rachel at Nursery had a grand idea.

Benjamin wasn\'t too clear what a market was exactly. He had supposed that it would be much like a supermarket, but apparently not. Benjamin\'s father delighted in telling him that whilst supermarkets were a relatively recent innovation, markets went all the way back to Roman and Greek times. Perhaps even further still, but the prohibitive expense of using his mobile phone whilst abroad meant Mr Reilly wouldn\'t stretch to checking Wikipedia, preferring relative ignorance to massive bills. It emerged that it was Benjamin\'s father\'s view that markets were far more exciting than their \\"super\\" equivalent because they were\\n\\n1. Outdoors and\\n2. Far less likely to sell washing powder and far more likely to sell tasty snacks.\\n\\n\\nThe family proceeded together on foot in the direction of the marketplace; Granny Annie, Benjamin, Baby James and Mr and Mrs Reilly. Well \\"on foot\\" perhaps does not describe James and Benjamin\'s modes of transport. James was snoring in the buggy with a sunhat on, being pushed by Mrs Reilly. Benjamin had opted to sit upon upon Mr Reilly\'s shoulders. Mr Reilly enjoyed his equine duties but, given Benjamin\'s not insubstantial weight, would have welcomed the occasional break. Benjamin disagreed, feeling it was better that he remained in the saddle, so to speak. It toughened Daddy up. He saw himself as much in the tradition of Yoda training Luke in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Though perhaps without recourse to the levitation of rocks and X-Wings accompanied by troubling hallucinations of Darth Vader.\\n\\n![](BenjaminAstrideHisNobleSteed.jpg)\\n\\nAs they entered the market, the first stall they came to was offering all manner of bread and baked goods. Alongside these were sold a Mallorcan variety of pizza which seemed to have replaced the traditional tomato base with a mixture of caramelised onions and peppers. Benjamin eyed the local speciality with some concern but finally agreed that they could procure a slice. \\"Uno, por favor\\" stumbled Mr Reilly in his pidgin Spanish, gesturing hopefully in the direction of the bready goodness.\\n\\nThe family took a seat on a wooden bench in a park that was located just to the side of the marketplace. Sat upon the bench Benjamin had decided that he definitely didn\'t like the pizza. Without first trying it he opined \\"don\'t like it\\" quite forcefully, fearing that, perhaps, it may even be poisonous. After about 10 minutes of special pleading by Mr and Mrs Reilly, Benjamin was persuaded to give a tiny corner of the pizza a try. \\"Mmmmm!!!\\" He intoned, delighted, and indicated that contrary to prior sentiments expressed he would actually be open to having some more.\\n\\nIt was obvious to Benjamin that by waiting 10 minutes before putting incisors to peppery bread, the flavour had been quite transformed and the poison dissipated. Mr Reilly was not so convinced; Benjamin\'s change of heart had rather put him in mind of that quotation attributed to Mark Twain:\\n\\n> \\"When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years.\\"\\n\\nThe park was of the sort that didn\'t allow dogs and, to inform patrons of this, large signs were hung here and there which featured the profile of a dog with a thick red line running through its head. As the family sat there, they watched a variety of dogs and their owners ambling slowly past the signs in and around the park. Granny Annie observed that rules and laws are generally regarded as symbolic in Spain. Few Spaniards feel particularly bound by them. In fact, in all likelihood the signs were only erected to put the Germans at ease. In some ways this could be seen as a charmingly relaxed Mediterranean attitude towards needlessly strict rules. After all who would honestly say they don\'t enjoy the spectacle of a golden retriever romping through grass of an afternoon? Not Benjamin, who basically considered himself quite pro-dog (provided the dogs weren\'t too large). However Mr Reilly had observed other side effects of the laissez faire attitude to the law, in the form of smoking in restaurants and pavements liberally splattered with dog waste. (Which had not been pooped, scooped and binned by their rebellious owners.) As such he felt that perhaps the Germans had something to offer on this occasion.\\n\\nIt was at this point the Reillys decided to try and pose for a family photograph. Baby James was, perhaps understandably, a little less than thrilled to be woken from his slumber, picked up and turned to face the noonday sun in all her beaming glory. Reviewing the photographs afterwards it was agreed that three out of four people facing the camera was not bad at all. Benjamin, seeing Mrs Reilly\'s phone, took the opportunity to grab it and bring music to the park. Earlier in the day, Benjamin had discovered a small pile of coins on a cupboard. They were the loose change that had been in Mr Reilly\'s pocket when they arrived from England. Given that the coins were of currency Pound Sterling and effectively useless in Mallorcan shops, Mr Reilly had discarded them until the return journey. Benjamin, feeling that big boys needed money, decided to take it himself and had placed the coins in the breast pocket of his T-shirt. As Benjamin jigged up and down to the tinny beats of mid-90s Erasure, a fountain of coins leapt from Benjamin\'s pocket filling the sand with shiny metal. \\"Oh no!\\" lamented Benjamin, looking entirely crestfallen. Fortunately for Benjamin the Aged P\'s were on hand and Mr and Mrs Reilly busied themselves on their knees excavating pound coins and fifty pence pieces from the earth whilst delicately trying to avoid some of nature\'s surprises, tucked away alongside. \\"Living the dream!\\" murmered Mrs Reilly, hands deep in the ground.\\n\\n![](FamilyPhoto.jpg)\\n\\nA little later on Benjamin was presented with the gift of a lolly by a kindly, well meaning man. \\"Ank-u!\\" Benjamin said. Mrs Reilly felt similarly about the notion of Benjamin eating a lolly as she did of the prospect of poverty, famine, war and death. \\"Think of the effect it will have on his teeth\\" she seethed inwardly. Benjamin didn\'t improve matters by then proceeding to suck the lolly hard and then exhale in an ostentatious fashion. Mrs Reilly realised, in a moment of absolute horror, that Benjamin was using his lolly to emulate a man smoking nearby. She is probably still twitching in a state of trauma at this very moment..."},{"id":"a-voyage-around-my-father","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/a-voyage-around-my-father","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2015-04-15-a-voyage-around-my-father/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-04-15-a-voyage-around-my-father/index.md","title":"A voyage around my father","description":"My name is James Edmund Reilly.

Hullo there! You seem a little bored. No matter; I have the remedy. Let me tell you about how my holiday began.\\n\\n![](ThatsMe.jpg)\\n\\nIt was Wednesday 15th April, 2015. In Twickenham, where I\'m proud to lay my hat, spring was determinedly springing. I awoke at 4:30am to the tuneful warblings of birdsong. Not wanting to be left out I decided that I would join my feathered friends in their early morning chorus. I gave voice and cleared the lungs with a good howl. I imagine it really added something to the melody. After around 15 minutes of this I felt I was done. By now I could hear daddy downstairs moving around and I settled back to rest, content in the knowledge of a job well done. Not only had I added to the music of the morning but I knew Daddy doesn\'t like to waste the day. I\'d given him the wonderful gift of an extra 2 hours of awake time before everyone else got up. I knew he\'d be pleased as punch. Mummy and I soon drifted off again.\\n\\nWhen I came to later on I was downstairs in the kitchen. Daddy was busy making coffee for a decorator. The man didn\'t speak English but it was clear to me he didn\'t actually want a drink. However that didn\'t deter my father and the frustrated decorator, seeing the way the wind was blowing, reluctantly acquiesced. It was clearly a strange British custom about which nothing could be done. I could see him thinking: \\"Things are far more straightforward back in the old country, to be sure\\". As soon as he could, he trotted briskly down to the bottom of the garden, bearing the newly presented Starbucks mug of the brown stuff. I think he was trying to keep as great a distance between himself and my father as was possible. Fair enough say I; Daddy can be an odd bird.\\n\\nWe were travelling out to Mallorca to see Granny Annie and Aunty Severine. Mummy and daddy then began to pack. Well, mummy did anyway. Daddy did a lot of looking alternately pensive, worried and bored. I\'m sure that was equally useful.\\n\\nWe boarded the train at St Margarets Station and changed at Clapham Junction for Gatwick. Benjamin, my elder brother, was in 7th heaven. \\"Trains!\\" he exclaimed, repeatedly. As people tramped past me they smiled. Yeah - I\'m cute me.\\n\\nThroughout the airport Benjamin insisted upon \\"shoulders\\". That is to say, he made Daddy carry him on his shoulders. Daddy did his best but after a while he seemed a little.. Droopy?\\n\\nAboard the aeroplane we took our seats. We had a whole row to ourselves. Benjamin sat next to the window. Mummy in the middle and Daddy took the aisle seat. Better for his leg he said. I sat on Mummy. Well, stood on Mummy would perhaps be more accurate. I didn\'t feel like sitting down - it was all so exciting!\\n\\nFor instance, in the row in front there were 3 ladies with peculiar voices. Australian, I decided. They looked most interesting. Priscilla, the lady in front of Daddy, had pink pink hair. Well, apart from the roots. They were another colour. Her face looked a little different to most ladies I know. There was lots and lots of powder on it. Also, her eyelashes were very bristly and black. Like a chimney sweeps brush. And her lips, matched her hair.\\n\\nI thought she would be worth investigating and so I reached forward to do just that. I wondered what her face looked like underneath and I elected to try and rub some of the emulsion off her to see. Daddy didn\'t appear to be completely on board with my plan and pulled me back. So I settled for a little play with her seat back instead.\\n\\n\\"My hair! He touched my hair!\\"\\n\\nPriscilla was freaking out. She rounded upon Mummy and said, in an accusatory fashion, \\"Children freak me out\\" (she wasn\'t wrong) and \\"Don\'t let it touch me\\". Following up with some other choice phrases.\\n\\nIt!!! It???!!? The painted lady had harshed my mellow somewhat. Mummy seemed a little anxious after Priscilla had finished her tirade so I held her for a while. She needed comforting. I also expressed my considered opinion of Lady P by filling my nappy. That\'d show her!\\n\\n![](ComfortingMummy.jpg)\\n\\nWith that I went to sleep and didn\'t awake until Mallorca. At the end of the flight Mummy and Daddy seemed a little bit broken. But not to worry; I\'ll take good care of them. They\'ll be fine soon. Probably."},{"id":"boyhood","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/boyhood","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2014-07-13-boyhood/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-07-13-boyhood/index.md","title":"Boyhood","description":"I just cried.

I\'m not an especially tearful person for the most part so that was kind of odd.\\n\\nLisette and I went to the cinema last night. It\'s our wedding anniversary on Monday and Lisette is due to give birth in a months time. So we felt an outing was in order - probably our last outing for quite some time.\\n\\nWe saw a film called \\"[Boyhood](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyhood_(film)>)\\". It moved me. It\'s a film pretty much like no other. You see a boy, Mason, age from about 7 to 19. It\'s amazing. It\'s not full of big drama - but it is full of the kind of things that happen when you grow up. It made me remember the things that happened to me when I was younger. I should say that my own life was easier than Mason\'s - there were far less genuinely scary adults in my own upbringing.\\n\\n![](boyhood-poster.jpg)\\n\\nBut so many of the things that happen reminded me of things I\'d forgotten. At one point Mason goes \\"camping\\" with friends in a semi-built house and they smash up bits of wood and throw circular saw blades at a wall for fun. I was similarly stupid and dangerous. Where I lived there were many new houses being built. When the builders would go home for the night onto the building sites my friends and I would romp. I remember throwing myself happily off the roofs of new houses onto piles of sand below. It didn\'t seem dangerous. It seemed fun!\\n\\nWhen Mason sets off for university he\'s excited. His mother is distraught. I remember my own parents driving me to university and mum being in floods of tears as they dropped me off. I don\'t think I appreciated that at the time - I was just delighted to be away on an adventure! Funny how human beings seem incapable of understanding someone else\'s perspective until they\'ve lived it themselves.\\n\\nSo why did I cry? Well, I\'m not sure. It was a mixture of emotions I think. Partly I\'m so glad I ended up where I did, with who I did, that I made it at all. It seems so clear from watching the film that life is incredibly tenuous. It\'s remarkable that any of us make it as far as we do. There\'s so many opportunities for something to go wrong.\\n\\nPartly I think I cried out of fear. I know my son Benjamin is going to face all this himself - or something like it; his own particular recipe of life. Bad things happen and I can\'t always be there to protect. I won\'t have the first clue half the time Benjamin\'s in danger. I\'ve got to let go - not yet I know (he\'s only 2) but it\'ll happen. I know deep down it wouldn\'t be good even if I could protect him anyway. If I don\'t let him live his life then he isn\'t really living life in a meaningful way. But I want to save him from harm - and certainly take the rough edges off life if I can. Like most parents (I expect) I\'m winging it, praying and hoping for the best.\\n\\nI think that watching the film at this time in my own life probably contributed to the reaction. So much is change. One son growing up quickly. Another son or daughter due to arrive in the outside world within the month. I\'m a bit overwhelmed. Excited - yes. Terrified - some. Alive - definitely.\\n\\n![](ben-in-the-front-garden.jpg)"},{"id":"500-days-of-benjamin","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/500-days-of-benjamin","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2013-11-15-500-days-of-benjamin/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2013-11-15-500-days-of-benjamin/index.md","title":"500 Days of Benjamin","description":"It\'s just over 500 days since Benjamin, my son, was born.

He doesn\'t talk yet but I\'ve no doubt it\'s in the post.\\n\\n![](2013-09-22+08.00.56.jpg)\\n\\nLately I\'ve been considering - how has becoming a father changed me? Because I know it has.\\n\\nTo a greater extent than I\'d like, the answer is fear. Put simply, I\'m terrified. I\'m terrified of something happening to Benjamin. I\'m terrified of him hurting himself, someone else hurting him or worse still, me hurting him. And lest I sound too narcissistic - it\'s not restricted to him.\\n\\nFact of the matter is I find much of the world more painful than I can bear anymore. I\'ve found I can\'t read newspapers these days. They are filled with tragic events. People wounding each other, people killing each other. And I can\'t take it. Not that it didn\'t used to bother me, it did, but my reaction now is far greater. For every person I read about suffering I know that that person was some mother\'s son, or some father\'s daughter and for reasons that I cannot satisfactorily explain that makes it painful for me to even consider. I realise this sounds incredibly self-indulgent. Believe me I don\'t mean it to be - but I\'ve got to be honest.\\n\\nThe flip side of this coin is the feeling of absolute joy that Benjamin brings to Lisette and I. Each morning we wake at about 6am. Lisette jumps in the shower, I go to the kitchen and make her tea (builders, milk, 1 sugar), me coffee (a large strong latte) and Benjamin gets 8 fluid ounces of full fat milk given 3 rotations in the microwave on full power. We assemble the drinks upstairs and then enter Benjamin\'s room to wake up the young master with a rousing chorus of Lisette\'s creation:\\n\\n*\\"Goooooooooooooooood morning, good morning! We love you very much, good morning, good morning to you! Goooooooooooooooood morning, good morning! You slept the whole night through, good morning to you!\\"*\\n\\nHe\'ll beam up at us and, after a little coaxing, present Lisette with his dummies (he sleeps with 3 in the bed just to be on the safe side). And then it\'s back to our bedroom where Benjamin will glug his way through about 80% of the milk before breaking off to play with various toys that we have scattered on the bed.\\n\\nEach day we\'re filled with enormous gratitude that God has blessed us \\\\***so**\\\\* richly. What a magnificent little man he is. How privileged we are to get to raise this jolly little boy. To have each other. It\'s wonderful and we are so grateful. I\'ve found I\'m coming to forget what life was like before we had Benjamin. That\'s one reason why I\'m writing this - I want to remind myself in the future how it felt in the past. In my head, it feels like we were just wasting time before Benjamin. I don\'t think that we were actually - what I\'m trying to say is that I\'d much rather be living the life I\'m living right now than go back to my life before parenthood.\\n\\nI guess that\'s it. Life is as it was before, but the emotional intensity is greatly increased. The joy has increased exponentially. And so has the fear. But it\'s worth it for the joy. Yes, it\'s definitely worth it.\\n\\n![](2013-10-27+09.33.08.jpg)"},{"id":"mum-and-dads-40th-wedding-anniverary","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/mum-and-dads-40th-wedding-anniverary","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2013-08-11-mum-and-dads-40th-wedding-anniverary/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2013-08-11-mum-and-dads-40th-wedding-anniverary/index.md","title":"Mum and Dad\'s 40th Wedding Anniverary","description":"On the occasion of Mum and Dad\'s 40th wedding anniversary I was prompted into making a speech.

I thought I\'d put the notes of the speech up here - they\'re pretty much left as I had them on the day and you\'ll notice the occasional PROMPT FOR ME TO ASK THE PEOPLE PRESENT SOMETHING in caps. This is the speech:\\n\\n---\\n\\nThanks for coming to Mum and Dad / Ann and Mark\'s 40th wedding anniversary. I\'ve been asked if I\'d say a few words. I wanted to talk about how we came to be here. How Mum and Dad came to be the people they are.\\n\\nAs far as I know, Mum and Dad met at York University where they were both reading Physics. I\'ve done my sums and I\'M GUESSING THIS WAS AROUND 1970?\\n\\nBack then you used to be paid to go to university in the form of a government grant. (Funny how things change.) Dad, upon receiving his grant, used about 70% of it to immediately purchase a new stereo. This reduced him to penury but at least he could listen to his music. Mum was more sensible and held onto her grant.\\n\\nI don\'t actually know how Mum and Dad met. HOW DID THEY MEET?\\n\\nEither way, romance ensued and Dad had little chance of walking away from Mum. As he had no money Mum effectively took up the role of feeding Dad in his early days at university. Along the way, presumably when Dad\'s funding situation had improved, there was a traumatic break-up - where Dad broke Mum\'s heart. The rotter. Fortunately for me, Mum and Dad ended up back together. They married in 1973 and subsequently moved to Bristol where they both took up teaching.\\n\\nNot too long after that I was born. You\'d think that having me was enough (the pinnacle, right?), but no. 2 years after my birth David was born and, pausing only to move house from Bristol to Fleet, Kirsty and Peter followed after.\\n\\nWhat you may not know is that there could have been more of us. In fact there would have been more... but for me.\\n\\nI would have been about 8 years old I guess when Mum and Dad approached me one bedtime and asked me if I\'d like another brother or sister. I think they were hoping for a sister for Kirsty in case she was overwhelmed by the prospect of having 3 brothers.\\n\\nHowever, this was the 80\'s in Thatcher\'s Britain and the iron of capitalism had clearly entered my soul. I had worked out that money was a finite resource and had the opinion that there wasn\'t enough of it flowing my way. 50p a week pocket money just wasn\'t cutting it. I knew that if there was another child around then the likelihood was that my pocket money would only decrease. This I could not have. So I said \\"no\\". Sad, but true.\\n\\nI came to realise that I had acted too late in many ways. Having David, Kirsty and Peter around was a disadvantage in other ways as well. When I asked Mum and Dad for a pet dog, a perfectly reasonable request for a young boy to make, they said I didn\'t need one as I had brothers and sisters. I was never convinced by this and, for the record, I would have happily swapped David for a golden retriever. By the way Aunty Kathleen, your bringing Tara to stay with us was one of the high points of my childhood. And when you took her away it was one of the low points. How could you Kath?\\n\\nIf you know Mum and Dad well then you\'ll understand that their faith in God is undoubtedly the most important thing in their lives. We were all brought up attending church, praying together as a family and, to my lasting regret, watching the Waltons too. (Dad felt they were a good example of a Christian family, albeit fictional, and one that we should seek to emulate) I\'m certain that Mum and Dad care deeply that their 4 children all came to faith, and indeed married fellow believers as well. Lisette and I certainly hope for the same for Benjamin and his cousins.\\n\\nWhilst I can\'t speak for David, Kirsty and Peter, I\'m not sure I would have come to faith without this strong Christian influence in my life. And although I didn\'t appreciate it at the time (I think I must have been forced to read the complete works of James Dobson and CS Lewis in my childhood) I now think that it was invaluable. And I\'m really grateful for it. Benjamin is going to have a very similar upbringing. Maybe without the Walton\'s though.\\n\\nSince I\'m a little older, and in fact particularly since we\'ve been blessed with little Benjamin, I think I\'ve come to understand why Mum and Dad had so many of us. And I\'m delighted to part of this small clan. David, Kirsty and Peter - it\'s wonderful to have you as brothers and sisters. And David I would no longer swap you for a dog.\\n\\nIt\'s an ongoing privilege to have such fine parents. Mum, Dad, you have been a blessing to all of us and we\'re so glad to have you in our lives. Thank you, both of you."},{"id":"so-this-is-parenthood","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/so-this-is-parenthood","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2012-10-11-so-this-is-parenthood/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-10-11-so-this-is-parenthood/index.md","title":"So this is Parenthood...","description":"It\'s now been 4 months since Benjamin was born.

I realised the other day that many things were happening. Each day there are changes; every morning something is different. And so I wanted to note down where we are, what\'s happened, how we feel, what it\'s been like.\\n\\nFirst let\'s take a look at the little man:\\n\\n![](P1060654+again.JPG)\\n\\nNow I know I\'m biased but isn\'t he gorgeous? I think it\'s safe to say that Lisette and I have become that which we despised: parents that dote on their progeny. We\'re wondering if he might have ginger hair. Looks a bit that way. And do notice his tongue. That tongue was the cause of a lot of trouble.\\n\\n## The Breast Things in Life are Free\\n\\nAfter the lad was born we\'d been told by other parents that the first 3 days can be quite tough. Or rather that after 3 days you\'ve run out of adrenalin and you\'ll be running on empty. We were. Feeding was not going well at this point. Lisette was absolutely shattered and Benjamin was pretty demanding.\\n\\nNow this may shock you but I hadn\'t thought much about breast-feeding up until this point in my life. I kind of assumed it just worked, natures lactic taps were miraculously turned on post-birth. Not so. Or at least it didn\'t seem to be plain sailing in Lisette\'s case. There was a lot of drama as different feeding positions were tried out (under-arm being the most successful). There was unquestionably a phenomenal amount of pain involved for Lisette. And the lad wasn\'t happy. He screamed. A lot. We were worried.\\n\\nWe were visited by a number of healthcare visitors and also by Mandy (continuing in the good egg stakes). The cult of breast-feeding quickly became apparent. The advice was nothing if not, well, consistent. \\"Breast-feed, breast-feed, breast-feed.\\" It\'s hard? Tough. The kid\'s unhappy? Ignore it.\\n\\nBabies weights are supposed to dip after birth. And there\'s an acceptable percentage by which their weights can dip. Benjamin dipped. And dipped. And dipped some more. However, we didn\'t actually know that this was the case at first. It emerged that maths was not the forte of the health visitors. They\'d calculated that Benjamin had lost the acceptable percentage of his weight and so he was fine. We should continue as is. But as it turned out their sums were wrong; Benjamin had actually lost rather more weight than they calculated. He was unsurprisingly a little hungry.\\n\\nIt was Mandy that observed \\"he\'s a little floppy\\" on one of her visits. She lowered her voice and leaned forward. \\"You could try topping him up.\\" So we did. Mandy had suggested that giving Benjamin a bottle probably wasn\'t a good idea as it might stop him breastfeeding entirely. Fair enough. So instead we would put tiny amounts of formula milk into a beaker and mid-scream (all he ever seemed to do at this point was scream) we would hurl the liquid down his throat. And repeat.\\n\\nIt felt like the oddest thing to be doing - but it worked. Benjamin settled. And screamed a little less.\\n\\n## Cat Got Your Tongue?\\n\\nApparently breast-feeding is supposed to hurt initially. But after that it\'s supposed to ease up. So a month later Lisette was quite distraught to still be finding it so painful. Each time she started feeding Benjamin there would be that clamping-on noise of Benjamin getting purchase followed by a yowl of pain from Lisette. Bit puzzling that.\\n\\nThe health visitors seemed unconcerned. I don\'t think they were thrilled we were topping Benjamin up with formula but they were at least pleased Lisette was persevering with the breast-feeding (despite the cost to her sanity). I returned home from work one day to have this conversation:\\n\\n\\"So, Lucy thinks Benjamin\'s got a tongue tie.\\" \\"A tongue tie?\\" \\"It means his tongue is stuck to the bottom of his mouth. Her Freddie had one.\\" \\"Is that bad?\\" \\"It means he can\'t feed properly, it hurts feeding for me, he\'ll have problems gaining weight and he\'ll have speech issues later in life\\" \\"So that\'s a tentative \'yes\'?\\"\\n\\nYou probably see where this is going... As it turned out, Lucy had been right. Benjamin did have a tongue-tie. And soon enough Lisette found herself in the waiting room to get it fixed up.

I was wrong. It all started out pretty easily I\'d say. Lisette was having contractions about every 5 minutes and they weren\'t enormously painful. This may have been helped by Lisette plugging herself into a \\"tens\\" machine. (I know; I\'d never heard of one either.) A tens machine is a small device which has extrudes pads which are attached to the small of the back (of the woman in labour) and deliver electrical pulses which sooth the contraction pain. It\'s supposed to be similar to the effect of rubbing your leg after you\'ve knocked it. Maybe it\'s hocus pocus; I don\'t know. But once plugged into the machine Lisette seemed pretty much okay. And it was a beautiful day on June 14th so we did what any self-respecting Brit would have done in the circumstances; we sat in the garden and had Paul the next-door neighbour round for tea. ![](Feeling+a+bit+tens.jpg)\\n\\n Over the course of the day the pain of the contractions got a little more intense but the delay between contractions didn\'t seem to decrease. In fact at points Lisette fell asleep and the delay would increase. That doesn\'t happen in the films. By the evening I was exhausted. The anticipation of imminent arrival combined with a fierce refusal for things to properly begin was quite wearing out my nerves. Lisette was tired too. I started dozing off on the sofa and in the end Lisette sent me to bed around midnight. I realise this sounds rather selfish but, as Lisette pointed out, there was nothing I could do and she needed me to have energy later. ## Orienteering\\n\\n I woke at 4am on June 15th to hear Lisette crying out in pain. That was really scary. Knowing your wife is in pain, that there\'s nothing you can really do about it and that the pain is only likely to get worse. Oh it\'s rotten. It\'s worth mentioning at this point that Lisette and I don\'t own a car. Consequently we were really dependant on the goodwill of friends to get to the hospital. Fortunately we\'ve been blessed with good friends and many people had said they\'d be happy for us to call them at any point. But we were terrified of going to hospital too soon. The nurses on a maternity ward can be like Gandalf in Lord of the Rings; \\"You shall not pass!\\" - repelling us like a Balrog. So many people are sent home and told to come back later. We feared that would be us. In retrospect I think our fear was slightly ridiculous. We were less scared of the prospect of going to hospital and coming back early than we were by the idea of the imposition and bad manners it would be to ask our friends to drive us back and forth a few times. This is undoubtedly a very British fear; I can\'t imagine any other nationality having similar qualms... However, it seemed the moment had definitely arrived. We needed to be at hospital sharpish. I called our next door neighbours, Paul and Fi, and after the momentary panic of their phone going to voicemail and me starting to search for a taxi number they called us back and arranged to meet outside. About 10 minutes later Fi was speeding us to the Queen Mary Maternity Unit of West Middlesex Hospital... <small><a href=\\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=embed&amp;saddr=St.+Margaret\'s+Rd%2FA3004&amp;daddr=51.46839,-0.32418+to:Unknown+road&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FWgpEQMdWhn7_w%3BFWZYEQMdrA37_ynVxcoWVAx2SDGhnreqLa4OEw%3BFYdvEQMd-wb7_w&amp;sll=51.46202,-0.328469&amp;sspn=0.015695,0.040941&amp;t=m&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;via=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.462136,-0.314655&amp;spn=0.034759,0.072956&amp;z=13\\">View Larger Map</a></small>\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"425\\" height=\\"325\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" marginheight=\\"0\\" marginwidth=\\"0\\" src=\\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=St.+Margaret\'s+Rd%2FA3004&amp;daddr=51.46839,-0.32418+to:Unknown+road&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FWgpEQMdWhn7_w%3BFWZYEQMdrA37_ynVxcoWVAx2SDGhnreqLa4OEw%3BFYdvEQMd-wb7_w&amp;sll=51.46202,-0.328469&amp;sspn=0.015695,0.040941&amp;t=m&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;via=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.462136,-0.314655&amp;spn=0.034759,0.072956&amp;z=13&amp;output=embed\\"></iframe>\\n\\n## Into the Hot Tub\\n\\n Upon arrival Lisette was declared \\"well on the way\\" (phew!). Then Mandy appeared. Mandy was a midwife that Lisette had met, and very much liked, before. \\"Mandy!!!\\" Lisette cried in between contractions, \\"I\'m so glad it\'s you!\\" Mandy asked if we had a birthing plan. Some people are very detailed about their birthing plans. They\'ll have clear ideas about what they want to happen and what they don\'t want to happen. Having spoken to people who\'d been there and done it, it sounded like birthing plans generally got forgotten in the moment and so there didn\'t seem much point to us in making one. Lisette just didn\'t want to take pethidine (a drug that makes babies groggy). Without any particular plan in place Mandy suggested the Natural Birthing Centre. Lisette was game so off we trundled. We found ourselves in a very warm dimly lit room with an orange lava lamp in the corner and a stereo playing Enya. In the middle of the room was a hot tub; around 3 times the size of an average bath. There was a rocking chair, a beanbag, a multitude of pillows and a bed. To my surprise there was also a knotted curtain suspended from a hook in the ceiling which looked to all the world like the sort of rope I used to climb in PE at school. Without futher ado Lisette clambered into the bath and was presented with her new constant companion; a scuba mask. The wasn\'t to enable underwater exploration but rather to inflate Lisettes lungs with laughing gas to ease the pain. Just the ticket. ## 8 Hours Later...\\n\\n I now realise that mid-wives are probably engaged in a form of ritualised deceit. From the moment Lisette entered the pool there would be vague but regular pronouncements of the sort \\"not long now\\" and \\"you\'re really coming on\\". This all lead to the not-unreasonable expectation on our behalf that birth was pretty imminent from 5am. So I was a little concerned at just gone 12pm that things didn\'t seem to have much changed in the intervening hours. Mandy had gone home after staying 2 hours past the end of her shift. She really is a good egg. In Mandy\'s place we now had the indomitable Sally and her apprentice Karen. A lot of time was being spent regulating the temperature of the pool. Karen would let water out. Sally would pour hot water in and stir vigourously (generally leading to faint cries of \\"too... choppy...\\" from Lisette). Thermometers would be placed into the depths and studied ferociously. Lisette had been in the pool, on the bed and on the beanbags. For a brief period of time I stood clinging to the knotted curtain whilst Lisette hung onto me. (I\'m sure it looked as odd as it sounds but it seemed to help - to my lasting surprise.) By now Lisette was back in the pool and I was growing increasingly suspicious of just how close to birth we actually were. They say the darkest hour is just before dawn and that seems to apply to childbirth. From Lisettes perspective the prospect of birth seemed to be less likely the more time ticked on. Sally said that this was to be expected and is a function of the way the child exits the body. It\'s not so much like a missile being launched; more like a mini-metro doing a 72-point turn. And each time the mini-metro backs up to re-attempt Lisette would become further convinced that the long expected birth was becoming a diminishing possibility. ## The Promised Land\\n\\n Happily, Lisette\'s fears were unfounded. After hours of not much happening things suddenly kicked into high gear. This part was like the films. There was noise. There was pain. It was intense. And suddenly, floating in the water, was a baby! Lisette collapsed against the side of the pool; understandably exhausted by her exertions. The baby stayed floating, a little pink island. At this point Lisette and I implicitly expected that the midwives would kick in. Isn\'t this the point when they\'re supposed to pick up the child by its hind legs, raise it up and ensure that it takes it\'s first breath? Not anymore it seems. \\"There\'s your baby... Pick up your baby...\\" Sally and Karen gently intoned. Lisette came to with a start and reached out to grab the floating child. ## \\"It\'s a boy!\\"\\n\\n A boy. A boy! I\'ve got a son! We\'ve got a son! Look, he\'s breathing. He\'s moving! He\'s got fingernails! He\'s got hair! This is amazing! The excitement Lisette and I felt when he was born. It was a moment of absolute joy. I wept. In a good way. I can\'t believe that we\'re alone in feeling that way. That wouldn\'t be credible. Has every human being born provoked that reaction in their mother, their father? Wouldn\'t that be wonderful? Wouldn\'t that be fantastic? I don\'t know if that\'s actually the case. But I love the idea that perhaps as everyone enters the world they create joy. And that\'s it. This is us; the brand new \\"us\\"! ![](Us.jpg)\\n\\n## Vital Statistics\\n\\n Our new son (son!) weighed 8lbs 1oz and was born at 12:37pm on June 15th 2012.

I tried addressing the man behind the counter: \\"Scusi Signore\\" I ventured (my Italian is not fantastic), \\"uhmmm, taxi... Scopello... Per favore?\\" The barman frowned. \\"Non. No taxis in Castellammare.\\" And there he left it. It had, all told, been a very long day indeed. Lisette and I had arrived the previous night in Scopello a town that sits roughly halfway between Palermo and Trapani on the West side of Sicily. We first visited Scopello the year before and liked what we saw. It was a magical, though undeniably tiny, place packed with restaurants and cafes and situated next to the Zingaro - a massive nature reserve. We only stayed there for a day on that occasion, and we loved it. Lisette and I have rules when it comes to travelling. It sounds a bit extreme I know but we\'ve found that following these rules has worked in our favour more often than not. *Rule #1:* Never go back - it\'s never the same the second time round no matter how much fun it was the first time *Rule #2:* Never book your accommodation - websites lie and some of the nicest places we\'ve ended up in have come about accidentally. *Rule #3:* Never stay in one place for the whole trip - why stay in one place when there\'s a whole country to explore? But this time we decided to break the rules. We knew Lisette would be 6 months pregnant when we went and so we probably needed to make some adjustments. We broke our rules. Every one. When we arrived on Saturday night in Scopello it was dark. The square was deserted and our only companions were the town dogs. All the restaurants were shut. <u>On Saturday night</u>\\n\\n. There were six people were staying in our hotel that night, two of those people were us. And our room turned out to be a vivid green in colour. For those of you unaware, green is a colour Lisette is only willing to tolerate in grass and leaves and she has outlawed it when it comes to interior decoration. Finally our room number was #13. I\'m not remotely a superstitious man but it kind of felt appropriate... We had broken the rules and the universe was extracting its pound of flesh. We had to take action. I woke early the next morning to find Lisette had a plan: - \\"Let\'s go to Erice!\\" - \\"We don\'t have a car\\" - \\"Not a problem. We catch a bus from the main square to Castellammare. Then we catch a bus to Castellammare train station. Then we catch a train to Trapani. Stay with me... you\'re going to like this... We catch a cable car from Trapani up the hill to Erice which is a pretty hill town with lovely streets and views and things... What do you think?\\" I liked the cut of her jib. And I very much liked the idea of a cable car. So an hour later we boarded the bus and were away. An hour after that we arrived at the train station and that\'s where the fun began.... Trains in Sicily seem to run in an entirely different fashion to trains in other countries. They are not apparently bound by schedules; certainly little of what we read in what we have dubbed the \\"Omert\xe0 timetables\\" came to pass. It feels as if trains in Sicily operate in a fashion closer to pirate ships than to commercial ships. One imagines the train driver and his crew rising in the morning to cries of \\"Avast me hearties - which fair stazione shall we bear to the day? We ride the seven rails etc...\\" It is at once a glorious and terrible anarchy which is only compounded by the insanity of the ticket situation. Namely, without a ticket you cannot ride the train. Which would be fine but when we sought to buy tickets the ticket office was shut. After we\'d missed a few trains (having been made to effectively walk the plank by various ticket inspectors) a man arrived on the platform sold us tickets and then went back home visibly worn out by his exertions. It quickly became apparent that in the off-season this is how Sicily functions. In Trapani, Lisette and I tooled along to the cable car to find it still shut for winter whilst proudly pronouncing on it\'s noticeboard that it had in fact opened for business 2 days previously. Still, we were not to be deterred and caught a taxi up the hill to magnificent hill town of Erice. We were delighted, we\'d set out to get to Erice without a car and by Jove we\'d followed this route and made it!: <iframe width=\\"500\\" height=\\"350\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" marginheight=\\"0\\" marginwidth=\\"0\\" src=\\"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Localit%C3%A0+Scopello&amp;daddr=Castellammare+del+Golfo,+Italy+to:Via+125+Contrada+Alcamo+Marina,+91011,+Italia+(Castellammare+del+Golfo)+to:trapani,+sicily,+italy+to:Strada+Provinciale+Trapani-Erice%2FSP31+to:38.02466,12.55169+to:Funivia,+Piazza+Umberto+I,+3,+Erice+Trapani,+Italy&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FfLpRAId1pLDAA%3BFYojRAIdVaPEAClBhbEYWYEZEzFjzHzYm2--og%3BFc40RAIdOgbFACGBs1BfYLm67g%3BFRweRAIdSvW-ACknMJ61m2EZEzEAIeI78BmMAw%3BFfg0RAIdMIO_AA%3BFdQ1RAIdCoa_ACkTfFsUymMZEzHR3bmBKQQLEw%3BFbhjRAId0P6_ACHNhFHfsxpOLCnNKGCncmMZEzElRhGqVuNuaw&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Funivia,+erice&amp;sll=38.025952,12.556086&amp;sspn=0.020081,0.027595&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=5&amp;sz=15&amp;via=5&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=38.066474,12.694702&amp;spn=0.378415,0.688019&amp;z=10&amp;output=embed\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<small><a href=\\"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=embed&amp;saddr=Localit%C3%A0+Scopello&amp;daddr=Castellammare+del+Golfo,+Italy+to:Via+125+Contrada+Alcamo+Marina,+91011,+Italia+(Castellammare+del+Golfo)+to:trapani,+sicily,+italy+to:Strada+Provinciale+Trapani-Erice%2FSP31+to:38.02466,12.55169+to:Funivia,+Piazza+Umberto+I,+3,+Erice+Trapani,+Italy&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FfLpRAId1pLDAA%3BFYojRAIdVaPEAClBhbEYWYEZEzFjzHzYm2--og%3BFc40RAIdOgbFACGBs1BfYLm67g%3BFRweRAIdSvW-ACknMJ61m2EZEzEAIeI78BmMAw%3BFfg0RAIdMIO_AA%3BFdQ1RAIdCoa_ACkTfFsUymMZEzHR3bmBKQQLEw%3BFbhjRAId0P6_ACHNhFHfsxpOLCnNKGCncmMZEzElRhGqVuNuaw&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Funivia,+erice&amp;sll=38.025952,12.556086&amp;sspn=0.020081,0.027595&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=5&amp;sz=15&amp;via=5&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=38.066474,12.694702&amp;spn=0.378415,0.688019&amp;z=10\\">View Larger Map</a></small>\\n\\n \\\\- \\"Lisette... You know we\'ve just arrived in Erice?\\" - \\"Yes my love\\" - \\"And it\'s all really pretty isn\'t it?

We\'re \\\\***that**\\\\* high up we\'re in the clouds!!!\\" - \\"Hmmmmmmm... well take a good look around because the last bus for Trapani leaves in 10 minutes.\\" - \\"Arrggghhhh!!!!!\\" Yes my friends, having travelled for 4 hours and spent a grand total of 20 minutes at our destination we now found ourselves heading back home nearly immediately. We were broken. Nothing was coming easily. Everything was hard work. We were not jolly. We were short changed by a ticket machine in Trapani (when even machines have turned against you know something is wrong) and once again denied entry to a train by Blackbeard the Bloodthirsty (ticket inspector 1st class). Finally we were in front of the bartender in Castellammare who was assuring us that there was no taxi service. We were pretty near tears and unsure what to do next. Then the bartender said \\"private car\\" and picked up the phone. He made a quick call and said to us \\"a man will pick you up in 10 minutes\\". We could have kissed him. True enough a man arrived shortly and started driving us the 5 miles to Scopello. He turned out to be a New Yorker who\'d moved over to Sicily from Queens some 29 years before. We talked as he drove: - \\"Really thanks for driving us. We were pretty stuck... I\'m John, this is Lisette\\" - \\"My name\'s Bernard. But I don\'t really like it. Sounds like a dog. You know, St Bernard?\\" I nod. - \\"I\'ve never liked Bernard. I prefer to go by \'Dino\' instead.\\" - \\"That sounds a bit like \'dingo\'\\" What was I thinking? I said it before I thought about it and in my head I now had Meryl Streep chiming \\"the dingo took the baby\\" on repeat. Bernard / Dino gives me a funny look. And well he might. I spend the rest of the journey thinking of what I can say to make things up. Finally I gush \\"Bernard - you\'ll never be a dog to us.\\" This tickles him.

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve completely succeeded. What I can say is this: Sicilians are \\\\***generally**\\\\* extremely vigorous and friendly. I have one caveat: Syracusians are excluded from this. They were the grumpiest, grouchiest, \u201cwe do not smile\u201d type people I\u2019ve ever encountered. Lisette actually made it her ambition to get a Syracusian smile. She failed! Wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible. But looking away from them and at Sicilians in the main let me present my evidence: - Seller of bus tickets breaks off mid transaction to seize the man behind him by the shoulders and kiss him on both cheeks. Don\u2019t see that on British Rail. \\n- Queuing. They don\u2019t. Lisette and my tactics of looking hopeful and trying to be polite frankly don\u2019t work in this society. My attempt to acquire some great smelling sausage from a marketplace was stymied by a million wizened old Sicilians pushing in front of me and waving fist fulls of Euro whilst berating the servers for not paying them enough attention. Lisette\u2019s attempt to get off a bus was a near tragedy as she refused to push her way off the bus and they responded in kind by pushing their way onto the bus leaving Lisette stuck in the back corner looking quite sorrowful and saying \u201cExcuse me, excuse me\u201d plaintively to ears that were not listening. \\n- Smoking. They do. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen a people embrace fags with this level of earnestness. If you smoke in Sicily then this is the preferred technique: lodge cigarette firmly in corner of mouth (ala Andy Capp). Do not let tobacco receptacle move but instead suck on it for dear life. Try not to exhale. That would be a sign of weakness and a waste. Instead seek to absorb every bit of tar, nicotine and smoke that\u2019s available. I must admit I\u2019m left most curious as to what life expectancy on Sicily is among smokers. My expectation would be that it is quite low. Tell you what though, when you see everyone firmly getting stuck in, it quite wants to make you give it a crack as well and see what all the fuss is about. Lisette is somewhat less convinced of this. \\n- Having purchased tickets on a bus to Palermo with our Pigeon Italian we realised that the bus driver had no clue that we didn\u2019t speak the language and sought to engage us in detailed conversation. For some reason he didn\u2019t pick up that we weren\u2019t following what he was saying and so lapsed instead into a pattern of saying \u201cSi!\u201d emphatically if we thought he wanted us to agree with something or waggling our heads sympathetically if a different response seemed appropriate. We had no idea what we were agreeing with or sympathising with at all. In my head I was imagining he was saying things along the lines of \u201cat least Mussolini made the trains run on time. And I tell you this: Berlusconi; he is no Mussolini!\u201d Things got easier at Cefalu when an Italian girl got on and offered to translate. It then emerged that the bus driver was blaming the traffic on someone throwing their mother-in-law into the road from a moving car. The girl looked a little embarrassed by this and didn\u2019t offer to translate any further.\\n\\n\x3c!-- --\x3e\\n\\n love, John and Lisette PS I am no Gok Wan but I would like to say this: wet look leggings were not designed to be worn in a loose fitting style.

(Though I think cats are all really wild at heart - the \\"domesticated\\" ones only fool you into thinking otherwise by turning up for dinner.) The wild cats seem to be happy and the Sicilians definitely encourage them. It\'s quite common to find a plate on the ground featuring a couple of slices of sausage which the local felines will be tucking into. Lisette and I had arrived in a hilltown called Enna (in the middle of Sicily) and were wandering from old church to old church generally marvelling. We entered the Duomo (a kind of cathedral from what I can tell) and inside found an unhappy young man called Antonio. He was the caretaker of the Duomo and he had a problem. One of the wild cats (henceforth known as \\"Tiddles\\") had crept into the Duomo and gone exploring amidst a stacked up collection of 5,000 chairs. Somewhere at the back Tiddles had got stuck. He wanted out. The Duomo resounded with the howls of the trapped cat. Antonio and I got stuck in; we spent a good half hour moving chairs away from the pile and essentially dug a passage through the chairs to where the howling was the loudest. We, unfortunately, could get no further through without causing a chair avalanche (chairvalanche?). Tiddles kept howling but did not come out to meet us. Antonio decided to employ his Sicilian cunning. He went away and came back with a piece of meat, the like of which I have never smelled before. It was beyond rancid; flies were gathering. Antonios logic was \\"cats like smelly food\\" and to that end it placed it just at the edge of our chair tunnel. He then waited. Tiddles was silent. Antonio became impatient, he decided to climb behind the chairs and retrieve the (now silent) cat himself. He failed. As he climbed down he landed on the smelly meat, it became stuck to his shoe and he strode the putridness around the Duomo unaware it was now attached to his left foot. By now the Duomo absolutely reeked and some puzzlement was gripping the people looking round the building. Lisette saw one woman surrepticiously glance about her and then, when certain she was unobserved, take careful sniffs of her armpits to ensure she wasn\'t the cause. Tiddles was ominously quiet. Antonio was optimistic and took this to mean Tiddles had slipped out when he wasn\'t looking. I thought it more likely Tiddles had passed out from smell-shock. Antonio had finally noticed the decaying rottenness on his foot and disposed of it. And in the absence of any further noise he slid all the chairs back into place. Just as he was walking away there was again the howl of cat that is stuck echoing around the church. Antonio was last seen digging a new passage through the chairs to rescue the unhappy Tiddles....

The coach swayed its way out of Taormina. And then stopped. Took on more people. We were off! And then we stopped. And took on more people. And... You get the picture. An hour after our initial departure an announcement came over the tanoy delivered in the style of a jaunty Rosa Klebb: \\"You are probably wondering what is happening right now?\\" she intoned. She was right! \\"We have just a couple little more stops to make and then we will turn and join the motorway...\\" Lisette had been slowly deteriorating for the last hour. Rocking from side to side and gently moaning to herself. Rosa\'s announcement coincided with the end of Lisettes tether. She cracked. \\"**ABANDON BUS!!!**\\" Lisette was out of her seat and heading down the stairs. \\"**SCUSI! SCUSI! Madam! SCUSI!**\\" she bellowed fighting her way up the aisle against the flow of traffic of people boarding the coach and coming the other way. By the time I caught up she was remonstrating with Rosa on the tarmac outside. Shortly after that Rosa and the coach departed down the road and Lisette and I found ourselves sat beneath an underpass in an indeterminite and none too pleasant town. Above us there were a collection of flags flying to no particular purpose. The Union (Jack) flag happened to be flying upside down; which I understand is the sign of distress. Seemed appropriate. The town we found ourselves in was completely unlike Taormina. It was like the Gorbals in the mid-80\'s. For some time we wandered from street to street seeking some method of identifying the town. In the end we found a cafe and looked up the address on the packets of sugar. It\'s called \\"Letojanni\\" and I wouldn\'t recommend it. Actually it seems to enjoy a further celtic connection. We found a pub in Letojanni; it specialised in one drink: Tennent\'s Super. Let\'s leave it there. ![](rundown-pub.jpg)"},{"id":"julian-assange-is-dead","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/julian-assange-is-dead","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2011-09-18-julian-assange-is-dead/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2011-09-18-julian-assange-is-dead/index.md","title":"Julian Assange is dead?","description":"\\"That\'s right isn\'t it?\\" said Lisette pointing at the Wikileaks frontmans picture. \\"Wasn\'t he poisoned by the Russians?\\" It\'s possible that Lisette is confusing Mr Assange with Alexander Litvinenko...

It\'s just I\'m currently reading a book called \\"Inside Wikileaks\\" which unsurprisingly features a picture of JA on the back cover. This purchase was a result of carrying out the \\"69 test\\" on a number of possible airport book possibilities. The idea is you read the 69th page of a book by which point the author should have got properly going. So you judge a book not by the cover but by how it seems to be panning out when underway. Not sure if it holds water but the Wikileaks book is properly interesting. Certainly more so than another book on the shelves called \\"How to make money from property\\" which features a serious looking man on the cover who may well have hemorrhoids (looking at the expression in his eyes). Performing the 69 test on said book netted the following sentence: \\"You can increase the square footage of....\\" Not something I wanted to study in depth in Sicily I felt.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis morning Lisette and I went to an English church in Taormina, Sicily where we are staying. There was a Scottish couple there who were renewing their wedding vows having been married for 40 years. Lisette wept tears of joy. Fantastic stuff. Afterwards we sat outside and drank wine and fanta with the (generally elderly) congregation who were an assortment of English, Scottish and New Yorkers (whose family came from Sicily). It\'s interesting how different cultures approach belief differently. The previous night we\'d seen the other end of the spectrum in the form of a very ornate church procession through the centre of Taormina. The focus of which was a statue of Mary which had been more decorated in earrings and jewels than you would have thought plausible. Left us thinking: Holy Mary Mother of God... you look a little like B.A. Baracus.... ![](http://top-people.starmedia.com/tmp/swotti/cacheBXIGDA==/imgMr%20T7.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n \\"Lately I\'ve been seeing things... Belly button piercings\\" - Black Treacle, Arctic Monkeys I can\'t remember if someone told me to first do this or whether I worked it for myself. Either way I\'ve now established a useful tradition when going away. Before I leave I buy an album on which I\'ve never heard any of the tracks but which I have high hopes of liking. I take it with me and only allow myself to listen to it when I\'ve reached wherever we\'re travelling to. That way whenever I subsequently listen to the music it always takes me back to where I first heard it. So the first Arctic Monkeys album reminds me of buses in Equador, the final Streets album reminds me of Chiang Mai in Thailand. The second Arctic Monkeys album reminds me of Venice and the third Arctic Monkeys album reminds me of Sri Lanka. My latest fix is the latest Arctic Monkeys album. (they\'ve given me good memories in the past so I\'ll trust them again) love John and Lisette PS Lisette is loving being the only natural blonde on this citrus isle :-)"},{"id":"euphemism-gravity-is-on-my-side","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/euphemism-gravity-is-on-my-side","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2011-02-24-euphemism-gravity-is-on-my-side/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2011-02-24-euphemism-gravity-is-on-my-side/index.md","title":"Euphemism / Gravity is on my side (Apparently)","description":"We were halfway up the mountainside and panting like dogs in a hot summertime when Ek, our whippet-thin guide, turned to me, patted me on the belly and said \\"when due?\\" before dissolving in peals of laughter on the ground.

Also the room had one \\"feature\\" that they hadn\'t told us about. At 5 am there was a faint popping and crackling noise followed by a \\\\***very**\\\\* loud \\"*Allahu Akbar, Ash-had al-la ilaha illa llah...*\\" Following the blind panic of coming to surrounded by deafening exhultations we realised that our room was placed next to the minaret of the mosque behind the hotel. (Which, being the ever observant and well researched travellers we are, we had completely failed to clock.)\\n \\n---\\n\\nThe next day we decided to head South, partly seeking a quieter start to the day, partly looking for a residence where we felt didn\'t feel like we were there under false pretences. (Not good if you\'re feeling the need to wrap up spare clothes in a sheet swaddling-style to carry around with you so fit in.) Ever seeking a little local expertise we sought the opinion of, I guess, a \\"Lantan\\" and asked to be directed to a more \\"backpacker-y\\" type place. She considered carefully and directed us to a beach called Klong Nin. Following her lead we rocked up to a the bungalows she\'d directed us too: \\"Is this definitely it - looks like the last place?\\" \\"That\'s the name she gave us. Rooms look about the same. Still quite heavy on the screaming baby front....\\" \\"Tonka toys floating in the pool; check. Can\'t really see any difference...\\" \\"Oh look, drugs!\\" Yes, sure enough, this residence was to all intents and purposes identical to the last, the conspicuous difference was that this place retailed narcotics. It wasn\'t shy about it either, it wasn\'t the case of a darkened room out of which people would furtively dart concealing contraband about their person. No. This stuff featured on the menu. Right next to the Margarita there was the \\"Mushroom Shake\\", and next to that the \\"Bhang Lassi\\". The list went on. Pondering matters a little further we have come to the conclusion that the term \\"backpacker\\" has become something of a euphemism in Lanta. If you say \\"backpacker\\" what they hear is \\"show us your class b\'s and c\'s\\". One of life\'s little learning exercises.

Something did not feel right. It started when we got in the taxi and asked to be taken to the hotel we had booked. The driver looked about as wired as they come and once we\'d given him the hotel address he processed to drive us into the middle of nowhere - to a sort of Thai industrial park. Door slams. Driver strides into strange office and tag teams a woman inside who rushes out and wrenches open the car door. \\"Where you staying?\\" \\"Um - we\'ve got a reservation thanks\\" \\"You no stay there - we get you cheap price\\" \\"We\'re fine\\" \\"What you doing tomorrow?\\" \\"Fine\\" \\"How long you staying?\\" Behind her, in the office, our taxi driver could be seen swigging deeply on bottle of beer and looking on. \\n \\n---\\n\\n We eventually reached our hotel. In silence. We checked in and found ourselves in a hot concrete cell with hole in the wall which was covered with mesh in place of a window. It was lit by a fluorescent light. Through the mesh hole in the wall could be heard the strains of a very violent film. We headed outside the hotel to examine Phuket. Next to the hotel was the \\"Pink Lady Cafe\\". There was the \\"Happiness Shop\\" which had pictures in the window of young slender Thai ladies embracing Western men of an older and more... corpulent... nature. Rubbish was strewn throughout the streets. Decay was everywhere. It was at this point that I remembered that I figured that Matt actually probably recommended Koh Lanta and said \\"avoid Phuket\\" and Lisette thought that she might have been here before 10 years ago and had some unpleasant experiences too.\\n \\n ---\\n\\n If you are ever taken by the desire to see what extreme tourism can do to a place then Phukets your bag baby. Never, I think, has a land been more pillaged, ravaged and left for dead by the desire to milk this cash cow until it bleeds. There was nothing left of any merit that we could see. Lisette and I understandably decided to skip town and since it seemed likely we had a recommendation for Koh Lanta we decided to head that way. Transport links aren\'t great between Phuket and Koh Lanta but suppose if you\'ve gone to one place what are the chances you\'d actually want to move to the other place? Surely you\'d only go to each destination deliberately. I bet the transport links between Israel and Palestine are no great shakes either. Anyway, we arranged passage on a series of boats and shook the Phuket dust off our sandals. We\'ve rationalised too. Although the John and Lisette that went to Luang Prabang in the alternate reality had a really great time, we think it\'s pretty probable they contracted malaria and died too. Well perhaps not - but telling ourselves that is slightly more preferable than facing the reality that we should have bought a guidebook published this millenium. Oh and maybe I should have listened more closely to Matt too.

The course was held in a school inside the city walls of Chiang Mai and was lots of fun. We visited the local market, cooked 7 or so dishes (including the mandatory but always appreciated Pad Thai) and had the very pleasant company of a very international group of folk cooking with us; Swedish (looking glamourous as you\'d expect) / Dutch / French (not the most talkative or friendly sorts but I best not cast aspersions on the national characteristics of Lisette\'s mother Annie) and so on. Funny how the presence of international sorts can have affect your own accent. Quite without meaning to I realised that was going a bit \\"Gor blimey guv\'nor, I\'m a cockernee sparra\\" which I attempted to remedy by speaking \\"proper-like\\" and ended up sounding like the ba$tard son of Elizabeth II and Dick Van Dyke. Strange. Also had it brought home to me once more that the expressions on my face bear little or no relevance to my actual thoughts. It\'s my fathers fault. I\'ve inherited his cro-magnon / Klingon forehead which lends me a sterner visage than I would otherwise have hoped. I\'m thinking happier thoughts than you imagine I promise! The cooking course was punctuated by many breaks during which the group would eat what we had just prepared and chat. During one of these breaks I observed to the group that it was interesting that with such a diverse collection of souls representing many different cultures that, by and large, all people present spoke English but spoke it with a pronounced American accent. I meant nothing particular by this; just an observation of the influence that America has on the world. However, I can only presume that I was projecting a deep sadness about the end of the British Empire that I certainly did not feel. There was a pause and then the Dutch girl in front of me leaned forward, patted my hand, and assured me that she felt that Britain would \\"rise again once more\\". Startled. Does my face secretly proclaim \\"Oh how I wish England had the Colonies again?\\" Perhaps. How to rectify?\\n\\n---\\n\\nSomething odd: have noticed lots of Japanese girls touring around done up to the nines and with a boyfriend in tow loaded down with photographic equipment. The entire basis of the relationship seems to be that the lad will take photographs of the lass against various glorious backdrops whilst she looks thoroughly unsatisfied and mournful. Not sure if the mournful thing is part of the look or maybe the mournfulness demonstrates the girls sadness that she cannot afford her own official photographer and so is having to make do...\\n\\nLisette and I are no longer in Chiang Mai and are best described as being \\"in difficultly\\". We\'ll spare you the details just now but hopefully things should improve soon we hope....

We are currently resident in Bangkok and making plans to head North to Chiang Mai.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI love my wife.\\n\\nThis hopefully doesn\'t come as a surprise to you but the fact was brought home at the start of the trip with a more emotional than usual departure to foreign climes. It started with Lisette and I attempting to board the Thai Airways flight to Bangkok in Terminal 3, Heathrow. We should actually have been attempting to board the British Airways flight - the bouncer (for want of a better term) set us straight on this by replying to our \\"Can we board please\\" with \\"That\'ll be a negative sir\\". \\"Negative\\" - I could have done with just \\"no\\" and he could have saved himself 2 syllables. Anyhow, we then clocked that our flight was leaving from the other side of the airport and so we performed a 10 minute sprint before boarding our British Airways flight panting like mad things.\\n\\nThis understandably didn\'t exactly endear us to our neighbours as when looking to recruit someone who\'ll sit by your side for 12 hours people are generally on the lookout for folk that don\'t appear to be sweating profusely or nearing death from asphyxiation. That said our arrival thus achieved, Lisette and I were soon separated as the in-flight entertainment was dead in our seats and so I was hived off to another part of the plane where equipment worked. (Lisette is a better sleeper than I and so voted to kip instead.) In my new seat I discovered I had the undoubted pleasure of sitting next to Mr Banks out of Mary Poppins before MP had done her good work on him and got him singing \\"Let\'s go fly a kite\\". This fellow read the Financial Times, cover to cover, for 9 hours... Fine paper, wont hear a word said against it - love Lucy Kellaway - but 9 hours? Come on!\\n\\nAnyway, since I was on my tod I decided to watch a film. I opted for \\"Never Let Me Go\\" which is an odd amalagm of romance, something else and science-fiction. Fantastic film. Didn\'t know much about it before hand but basically it\'s unrequited love, requited love and then - well I won\'t spoil it. But it affected me. Deeply. By the closing credits I was a shaking, dribbling, snotty wreck of a man. Weeping uncontrollably and heaving with emotion. Mr Banks looked quite worried by this turn of events and I caught him taking the occasional concerned look at me over the top of his paper.\\n\\nI couldn\'t help it. I commend this film to you. Watch it. It\'s the kind of film that leaves you grateful for the blessings you have and grateful that you are loved and have someone to love. I\'m still affected now I think.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis morning we ventured out with Lisette\'s \\"Rough Guide to Thailand\\" which was published in 1997. This makes it practically an antique and nearly nothing in it is true anymore. There\'s the occasional sentence in it which gives it away; phrases like \\"tsunami\'s have never troubled Thailand\\" and \\"here be dragons\\".\\n\\nWe made our way across town in a taxi (and Steve if you\'re reading this you\'ll be delighted to know that the cabbie was a Liverpool supporter :-)\\n\\n - pretty much the only English word he knew besides \\"Premiership\\") and visited the Christ Church Bangkok. There is something wonderful about being on the other side of the world and meeting people who look nothing like you but with whom you have something in common. The church was somewhat surprisingly led by lovely man of Essex called Peter Cook (no relation to Dudley Moore). They put on a lunch in the building next door afterwards and so Lisette and I headed along. Fiery. But very good. Got chatting to a Thai lady next to us called Sarah who was lovely and turned out to be much older than we had imagined. I\'m thinking that Thai woman probably age quite well.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhen we returned to where we\'re staying near the Kho San Road we found that the restaurant we ate at and then watched burn down was now alas a blackened shell. However, time was not standing still and the workers weren\'t either. Much like ants repairing a decimated anthill, they were busy cleaning it out and preparing for the renovation already. Wish them well.\\n\\nWe\'re now heading off to dinner - we\'ll pop back tomorrow and see if the building\'s still standing. Curious and vaguely concerned to see if we are leaving arson in our wake.\\n\\nlove John and Lisette\\n\\nPS Ever wondered how Cheryl Cole was actually managing to make a living with her music post Girls Aloud? (Surely I can\'t be the only one pondering that) Well I have the answer - it\'s the Thai\'s! They love her! Can\'t move for renditions of her debut single as a solo artist. Though Thai is a tonal language and the locals seem to struggle with an English consonant. So it\'s a bit \\"Figh\', Figh\', Figh\', Figh for this lo\'e\\" if you follow me.\\n\\n![](P1030451.JPG)"},{"id":"witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2010-09-21-witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2010-09-21-witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu/index.md","title":"Witness to a Crime (I know kung fu)","description":"Hi all, Have had eyes opened to the seedy underbelly of France.

Had some notion of returning home hirsute and resembling a character out of Dickens, John Jasper perhaps or Bill Sikes. Really felt I was making good progress as I examined my countenance in the mirror this morning. However my self-image was somewhat punctured by Lisette\'s comment of \\"I know who you look like: David Bellamy\\". Two steps forward and three steps back then. I\'m not still shaving though.\\n \\n---\\n\\nThis morning I tried something different. Looking out as the sun rose above the Loire while we breakfasted I wrote a poem! Is very short, almost a haiku really - it\'s very simple and it describes the events of the wife\'s preceding half hour. Here goes: Market, Rillette + Baguette: Lisette... Granted it\'s not quite \\"step aside John Betjeman\\" quality but I remain quite pleased. To illustrate the poem I include a picture of Lisette \\"in the moment\\": \\n\\n![](P1020009.JPG)\\n\\n---\\n\\nToday Lisette and I rented bikes and cycled from Amboise to see the chateaux in Chenonceaux. The bike was rented from a shop that was 50% cycle shop and 50% wine cellar. Not clear if the guy that owns it was looking to serve the same market with both products - feel that could be a poor business plan on the road safety front... The chateaux was mighty impressive - and I believe it may have been used as the basis for Herg\xe8s Captain Haddocks mansion? Day concluded at the \\"Bigot Patisserie\\". No sign of Nick Griffin, presume that \\"Bigot\\" has some innocent English translation. Either that or the shop is owned by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Bon Soir, John and Lisette PS Saw a comic book this morning entitled \\"Sarkozy et Les Femmes\\" on the front of which was a sleazy looking dwarf-sized representation of the French President surrounded by women towering over him.

So there\'s been a lot of \\"comme ci comme \xe7a\\" and \\"pourquoi\\" going on. I think it sounds terrific! Lisette, not so much.\\n\\nSo far we\'ve travelled down from Paris and West along to Chinon. Since then we\'ve turned tail and headed back East to Loches via Tour and today to our current location of Amboise. Along the way we\'ve been battling the irregular and frankly downright odd public transport. Peculiarly there are train lines but only about 3 trains a day available to catch. The rest of the time you need to go to the train station, buy a train ticket, validate the train ticket on the train platform, and then catch a bus outside the front of the station... No clue as to why. Further to this we\'ve found the signage quite perplexing. If you want to go somewhere, let\'s say the town centre for instance, all you need do is take a look around until you see a sign that reads \\"centre ville\\" with a helpful arrow pointing left. But wait! There is also a sign saying \\"centre ville\\" and pointing right... What to do? This situation has been repeated and repeated throughout the Loire (in fact throughout France I suspect). They may all technically be true in that it is indeed possible to circumnavigate the globe. That said, I would have thought that it would prove at least passingly useful to know which was the more, shall we say, \\"scenic\\" route in any given situation...\\n\\n---\\n\\nLast night in Loches, Lisette and I took the opportunity to eat a Medieval meal in a restaurant set in a 15th century chateaux. The meal began simply enough with goblets of mead and spiced wine (not dissimilar to the mulled wine of Christmas but taken cold). It continued with a sort of pea and garlic soup. At least that was the working assumption until we dredged up Kermit\'s leg from the bottom of the bowl... It was at this point that we realised it was a \\\\***different**\\\\* sort of green soup. I should say though that it wasnt unpleasant and contrary to expectations it tasted nothing like chicken. More like fish really. This was followed up with the unusual combination of wood pidgeon and cooked grapes which was surprisingly tasty. To finish we were served prunes that had been steeped in alcohol. I did not like prunes before and do not like them now. I\'m sure it\'s a useful life experience though. And healthy I dare say. love, John and Lisette \\n\\n![](P1010977.JPG)"},{"id":"on-seine-in-membrane","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/on-seine-in-membrane","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2010-09-13-on-seine-in-membrane/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2010-09-13-on-seine-in-membrane/index.md","title":"On Seine in the membrane","description":"Dear all, Am typing this on the strangest keyboard I have ever encountered.

To my disappointment though Montmartre was nothing like in Moulin Rouge - granted, a film - it turned out seedier than a parrots breakfast. French men look mighty clean. There are also indecently enamoured of draping jumpers over their shoulders and wearing scarves. It should be noted that they dont approach the scarf in the manner of that mighty Doctor Who Tom Baker. No, instead the scarves are wrapped repeatedly round the neck until they resemble a member of that tribe (possibly African but not sure) which extends the length of their necks by wearing multiple metal bands betweeen their shoulders and their chin. Still - tres chic I\'m sure.\\n \\n ---\\n\\n Will be losing no weight on this holiday. Lisette and I have just emerged from a 2 hour lunch in a lovely restaurant in Chinon in the Loire region of Northern France. Alas I fear we are doing no good for the reputation of our people. We ordered the local sausage to start and, it being France, we were also presented with a bowl of sliced up baguette as well. Since we had been given the necessary components we decided to take the obvious next step and assemble the ingredients into a very superior hot dog. This is apparently not quite the done thing. The waitress clocked us doing this and her eyebrows shot up to the middle of her forehead and she blasphemed quite audibly. She then backed tentatively into the kitchen where she could be heard hissing \\"Jean Pierre, they are making \\\\***sandwiches**\\\\*\\"! We tried to rescue the situation later by remembering to order espresso to finish rather than cappucino and eating the full sock drawer in the way of cheese but I fear the damage was already done. We are unquestionably Phillistines of the lowest order...

Dalek. Hi all, Many things I am capable of but, as I discover, many things are unwise. Lisette and I were woken at the princely time of 1:50 am and tumbled out of bed, into clothes and into the blackness outside. The plan, such as it was, was to climb Adam\'s Peak which is either the fourth or fifth highest mountain in Sri Lanka (Asanga and the Lonely Planet are still arguing the toss on this point). The plan was to reach the summit and watch dawn break from the top. Also, Adam\'s Peak famously casts a shadow the shape of a roughly equilateral triangle just after dawn breaks which we were also hoping to see. Climbing a mountain in the dark is less fun than you might imagine. There\'s a lot of stumbling, wheezing and general bitter self-recrimination as to why you ever agreed to doing this in the first place. There\'s also a fairly worrying amount of losing the people you\'re travelling with as well. In the event we did finally make the ascent, reaching the Summit at roughly 6 am.

Dalek. Hi all, Many things I am capable of but, as I discover, many things are unwise. Lisette and I were woken at the princely time of 1:50 am and tumbled out of bed, into clothes and into the blackness outside. The plan, such as it was, was to climb Adam\'s Peak which is either the fourth or fifth highest mountain in Sri Lanka (Asanga and the Lonely Planet are still arguing the toss on this point). The plan was to reach the summit and watch dawn break from the top. Also, Adam\'s Peak famously casts a shadow the shape of a roughly equilateral triangle just after dawn breaks which we were also hoping to see. Climbing a mountain in the dark is less fun than you might imagine. There\'s a lot of stumbling, wheezing and general bitter self-recrimination as to why you ever agreed to doing this in the first place. There\'s also a fairly worrying amount of losing the people you\'re travelling with as well. In the event we did finally make the ascent, reaching the Summit at roughly 6 am. It was a pretty impressive sight. However, for some reason I appear to be wired to be underwhelmed though. As Lisette bounced around like Tigger, delighted in the vistas abounding my own eyes were cast down gazing at the vast tract of pathway we had traversed and pondering the joys of doing the self-same trip in reverse. Oh exquisite agony here I come. ![](P1010067.JPG)\\n\\nTo complete the full round trip (bed to summit to bed) took about 7.5 hours - we hobbled back into our quarters around 9:30ish. And felt pretty bad. (Physically - obviously we were mentally quite impressed with our own derring do and what not) This pain was a mere taster though of what was to come; the next day came the real kicks. Lisette and I woke with legs which appeared unwilling to bend more than a fraction at the knee. And that with muscles protesting like Greeks. After no small amount of yelping we fashioned a way of transporting ourselves, shuffling much in the manner of penguins. So: Breakfast. Out the door, turn right, shuffle 10 paces, turn right, shuffle 10 paces, turn left. Stairs. Oh. It was then that Lisette and I realised that we had been transformed effectively into an early iteration of Doctor Who\'s finest adversary: Daleks. That\'s right, we can do \\\\*anything\\\\* - but we can\'t do stairs.... ---\\n\\nIn the words of Vincent Vega: \\"it\'s the little differences\\". Lisette and I were strolling round Kandy the other day and amongst all the completely foreign (well it is Sri Lanka) architecture we spotted a remarkably English looking church. In fact it looked very much like our own St Stephens - reason enough for us to poke our heads round the door. When we did we were presented with a church that looked indistinguishable from a church at home. We discovered the caretaker who was busy clearing up masses of broken glass on the floor. It turned out that this was the result of a tree hitting the building in the night. Thrown by the elephant that lived next door. You dont get that in Twickenham. Speaking of elephants, I have made an important discovery: not all elephants have tusks. I am relieved. Growing up I had always believed that elephants always had tusks. And if they didn\'t have tusks that meant only one thing: the evil ivory hunters had been plying their trade by plucking the teeth of the poor pachyderms. Since arriving in Sri Lanka I have been presented with a large number of tuskless elephants and had been busy mentally berating large swathes of the Sri Lankan population whom I believed to be responsible for elephant abuse. All without cause I am happy to say: only something like 3% of Sri Lankan elephants grow tusks. Shouldn\'t be so quick to judge. ![](P1000664.JPG)\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow staying in a hotel on the South coast of Sri Lanka. Quirky. The lock on the door is upside down. So to lock the door, you have to unlock the door - and vica versa. Other unique features: - a phone attached too the sink. Perhaps so you can talk while you brush your teeth. - a toilet roll holder fitted 10 centimetres from ground level. Possibly installed for Lilliputian customers? - a television set on which no channels work. For those that love the soothing sound of white noise. Oh dear, internet connection is going a little haywire here. Signing off while I still can.

Even Lisette (bearing in mind her boundless enthusiasm for heat) has declared that it\'s \\"a bit much\\". If you\'d like to paint a mental picture of me at present you should imagine a man in a sauna, fully clothed and eating curry. I\'m hot.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI\'ve been to Happyland. Happyland, it turns out, is a spice garden on the way to Kandy. We visited it yesterday and were greeted by quite a short man (even by Sri Lanka\'s somewhat petite standards). In the full heat of the day he dressed in manner of a character straight out of \\"Wall Street\\": full suit, a coloured shirt with white collar and cuffs, designer glasses, teeth whiter than the sun - and maybe even braces (but that might be my imagination running away with me). I never learned the mans name, but as he led us around his garden (lair?) and showed off various plants / seeds etc I mentally came to categorise him as one of the Bond-villains that has yet to be. For the sake of reference I shall refer to him as Professor Magic Plant (PMP). Apparently PMP has cured \\\\*everything\\\\*. His tour went something like this: \\"and here we have plant X, it cures the common cold. And here is fruit Y - it prevents cancer and makes you thin...\\" The tour concluded in a open air tent where we all perched upon benches in front of him, the great showman. We were told that we were to see some \\"great Asian magic\\" and that a lady was required. Ever shy and retiring it turned out that all the Tour-ettes were for some reason otherwise engaged. Possibly having made the same mental assessments that I had. PMP cast the net wider: \\"Perhaps a gentlemen would be obliging?\\" The Tour-ettes felt this was very good idea and my very own Tour-ette Lisette went so far as to nominate me saying \\"John will do it. Won\'t you John?\\"\\n\\n![](P1000755.JPG)\\n\\nI was then brought to the front of the tent and one of PMP\'s unlovely assistents smeared an unknown pink cream on the back of my right hand. I then returned to my seat. At this point Big George (one of the Tour-ees) decided he\'d definitely got the measure of PMP and exited stage left (pursued by a bear?). Last seen heading in the direction of the tourbus. Whilst Lisette and I continued to stare at my hand a number of demonstrations took place. Some foul smelling liquid was passed round for tasting. Made from pineapples I think. Then a forced massage was given to all the remaining audience members save me and Lisette (who resisted the greased up assistants of PMP quite forcefully). Once the fellow audience members had been fleeced of their roupees PMP addressed us. \\"And now is time to see the great Asian magic... Come forward\\" (pointing at me). I went forward feeling no little trepidation. It\'s not every day that Paul Daniels evil Sri Lankan cousin experiments on me. From his pocket PMP dramatically pulled some Kleenex. He then rubbed the Kleenex on the back of my hand to reveal..... no hair. \\"Is all natural!\\" beamed PMP whilst I, somewhat forlornly, compared the hairiness of my left hand to the hairlessness of my right hand.\\n \\n![](P1000756.JPG)\\n\\nI\'ve never felt so underwhelmed and yet relieved at the same time.

Expectations suitably lowered.\\n\\n![](P1000004.JPG)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the time since our arrival I am proud to say that Lisette has been performing a valient service. She has selflessly allowed herself to be attacked by swarms of mosquitos thus sparing her loving husband from suffering the same fate. Given the choice between tough-skinned John and fair-of-leg Lisette the mozzies are in \\\\*no\\\\* doubt. They\'ll take Geordie meat any day. At last count Lisette had about 20 bites. I have a small one on the knuckle of my right hand. Lisette is truly my sacrificial anode.\\n \\n---\\n\\nThe tour has properly kicked off now and we have been busy. So far we have: - Eaten some very hot food - proper \\"crikey-get me water\\" curries. Experienced some very hot and humid weather. - Been out on a boat at dawn watching a variety of dolphins hurl themselves out of the water like so many grey-skinned teenagers doing skateboard tricks - Travelled round several of the \\"most important archeological monuments in the world\\" (Asangha\'s words) - Inspected a number of \\"eighth wonders of the world\\" (also Asangha\'s words... hmmm) - Travelled from the coast of Sri Lanka to Habarana in the steep hill country. And it\'s in this last point that lies the rub. It has occurred to me that I have become a prisoner of circumstance. Lisette, I, (and the tour-ees / tour-ettes) are holed up in a hotel in Habarana. There is nothing in Habarana - it\'s a one-elephant town. Normally, Lisette and I like to get out and explore. See what the town has to offer. Go for a meal etc. Can\'t do any of that. So we\'re kind of stuck either doing stuff on the tour or stuck on hotel grounds. Not that it\'s an unpleasant hotel. It\'s kind of like a \\"nice\\" version of a World War II Prisoner-of-War camp. (Hence my allusions to the Great Escape - not too sure who Lisette would be in that scenario so lets skate over my inaccurate analogies). As well as this, we are caused to rise very early every morning to \\"get the best of the day\\". Tomorrow we\'re up at 5:30am. Today we were up at 6:30am. The day before yesterday we were up at 4am. Not quite my bag baby. So not sure yet if tours are \\"us\\". We shall have to see if this pans out...\\n\\n![](P1000022.JPG)\\n\\n---\\n\\n That\'s me for now. I\'m off to read my book as unfortunately (definitely from Lisette\'s point of view) the weather has turned. We have gone from a combination of body-melting mid-thirties sunshine and humidity to the monsoon season. (which I didn\'t think Sri Lanka had - but you learn something new every day) Toodle-pip.

This was not to be. ![](DSCF4772.JPG)\\n\\n \\"As the crow flies\\" is a fatal way of looking at the world in these parts. It fails to take on board the matter of scrabbling up hills, down mountainsides and also the furnace-like heat - none of which does the humble crow have to contend with. Shortly after departing Firostefani (\\"our digs\\") these points came sailing right home to us. Regular examination of the GPS map on my phone made us realise just how far we actually hadn\'t travelled. Nevertheless, we pressed on, and were indeed rewarded by many a fine view. About halfway through our hike we came upon a very beautiful chapel sitting on top of a peak. Looked straight out of Mammi Mia. (Which was I think filmed on a Greek island?) Lisette took time to take scenic photo\'s of the church. I sought shade and took time to empty the the last of the water bottle (gentleman that I am). It was at this point I became aware of dog scampering around the church in a jolly fashion. The breed of the fellow was unclear - \\"blonde mongrel\\" is probably the most apt description I can come up with. For some reason (and with no objection from me since I am a general fan of dogs) the dog decided that he was going to stick with us for a while. So we descended from the chapeled-hill, Lassie in tow - occasionally running ahead, occasionally drifting behind. The path which we had followed so far had basically been a footpath which wound through the hills of Santorini and passed through the occasional town. However, the path now came to an end and forced us to walk on the main road until a new path started later on. The dog was still with us at this point and was taking a turn at leading. Given the dog seemed to be several years old and still alive, we had every expectation that it had mastered road safety as a young pup. - Consequently, his actions when the first car rounded the corner were not less than staggering in our view. Traffic (the name we subsequently attached to the dog) reacted to the presence of a distant car in a rather different fashion to myself and Lisette. We, having observed the way the Santorinis drive, pretty much attached ourselves to the cliffside as we waited for the car to make it\'s way past. Traffic, on the other hand, made his way into the centre of the road. Hackles up and snarling he crouched, facing down the approaching car. Daring it to look him in the eyes, he pounced, leapt up, and raced, barking madly, directly at the car. Lisette and I were at this point screaming, watching in slow motion, imagining the only possible future that could present itself. And then with seconds to spare, the car swerved, narrowly avoided hitting Traffic, further narrowly avoided going off a mountainside and then slowly swerved left and right up the road until it returned to normality. Traffic, meanwhile, stared proudly at his bested conquest. That\'s right Ladies and Gents - we have found a dog that plays \\"chicken\\" with cars! I would like to say that this happened only once and that Traffic learned his lesson. He did not. With every car that came round the corner the same scenario was repeated. The only difference was that Lisette and my screams got louder each time. -Convinced with each iteration that this would be the one. This would be it. But no, Traffic lived to fight another day each time and for all we know may still be there doing the same. Lisette and I will never know though because as soon as we came upon the new path up from the road we legged it and didn\'t look back. For my part I am choosing to believe that Traffic has special powers and will live forever.

Want to go shopping? Go hiking first... And there are no shortage of shops / restaurants and similar here. Lisette and I were initially very worried upon arrival as despite having packed everything else we had left behind any kind of phrasebook. Normally we at least know a couple of numbers, \\"please\\", \\"thank you\\" and \\"could we have the bill please?\\" - not so this time. So our expectation was to spend our time here doing a lot of wild gesticulation and general mime just to get by. Fortunately for us everyone seems to speak English. I exaggerate though - I could remember 1 Greek phrase. Petros (university compadre) had advised me before my departure that \\"thanks\\" in Greek is \\"eff-Harry\'s-toe\\". I was a little suspect of this as it sounded quite long for just \\"thanks\\". As a result I decided to do a little market research before actually employing it willy-nilly. (In case Pet had been having a little joke...) Lisette and I were elbows deep in baklava at a very friendly cafe yesterday and, in conversation with the very jolly owner, confirmed that, yes indeed, \\"eff-Harry\'s-toe\\" was as promised. The jolly owner clearly felt that we were firm friends now that this had been established and seized me by the arm. \\"Come!!\\", he bellowed and pulled me inside the cafe, \\"you must see!!\\" I was a little concerned by the, to be frank, mania that was being emitted from the mans eyes but since he was very strong I went with him until the vice like grip on my arm slackened. Before us was a cardboard box, sitting on a table. \\"Birthday cake!\\" the cafe owner bellowed. He then flicked open the box to reveal a cake with an image emblazoned upon it which, were it published in a magazine in England, would land it straight on the top shelf - possibly even behind the counter in a brown paper bag. They clearly do birthdays differently in Greece. Alas there were no candles present and so I can\'t inform as to the age of the recipient. I\'m assuming it wasn\'t a kiddies birthday cake but stranger things have (probably) happened. ![](21092009557.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe do appear to have landed on the island of strange cover versions. Lisette and I were sitting in a cafe the other afternoon and watching the cable cars go up and down from Fira to the port. There was the typical sort of background music playing over the cafe stereo - old Roxette tunes and whatnot. Then Lisette observed that we appeared to be listening to Gregorian monks chanting. Upon further examination the Gregorian monks were in fact chanting recognisable song lyrics. In fact, they were intoning the lyrics of REM\'s \\"Losing My Religion\\" - quite the unexpected song for a Gregorian monk (of all things) to chant, I think you\'ll agree. We\'re not sure if the Gregorian monks actually knew what they were chanting. It\'s possible that this was some kind of monk-ish ironic dig at Michael Stipe but they did sound very serious. And to be honest it\'s hard to imagine a monk standing up (presumably in a monestary somewhere) and saying (in a Michael Caine stylee) \\"hold on lads - I\'ve got an idea...\\" before relaying plans to cover said song. There is also the possibility that the monks didn\'t speak English and didn\'t actually know what it was they were chanting... However given the general English ability of the island shopkeepers this seems somewhat unlikely... Perhaps we\'ll never know... The mystery grew ever stronger the next day as when examining the wares of some merchant or another we became aware of KRS-ONE\'s \\"Sound of da Police\\" being intoned in traditional Greek singing style. Sample lyrics: \\"Whoop - whoop, that\'s the sound of the police, Whoop - whoop, that\'s the sound of the beast....\\" Imagine, if you can, that being performed in the style of \\"Zorba the Greek\\", accompanied by a mandolin, and sung by a man who sounds imminently about to break plates and down gallons of ouzo. Very strange. We are now on \\"cover-version watch\\" - ever waiting for the next installment... love, John and Lisette"},{"id":"dieting-italian-style-in-cinque-terre","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/dieting-italian-style-in-cinque-terre","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2008-10-22-dieting-italian-style-in-cinque-terre/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2008-10-22-dieting-italian-style-in-cinque-terre/index.md","title":"Dieting Italian style in the Cinque Terre (Only Mad Dogs and Englishmen...)","description":"We have arrived in the Cinque Terre which is on the North West coast of Italy.

There are no real hotels inside the Cinque Terre and the books (Lonely Planet and the \\"<s>Rough</s>\\n\\n Rubbish Guide to Italy\\") advise staying with locals. Accordingly we found ourselves following a burly, and I thought rather scary, Italian man home from the station after we arrived. Despite initial trepidation we ended up at a lovely apartment with a view of the sea at a fair price and with a gushing landlady who is wont to say things like \\"you should-a make-a the hay while the sun-a.... shines!\\". I think that at other times of the year we would be sharing this accommodation with every man and his dog but this being the off season we\'ve fallen on our feet. Our attempts at making hay are mixed. The best idea is to rise early and be on the walking trails by 9am. Lisette and I have not quite managed that being somewhat on the tired side as well as being foxed by the unusual behaviour of the sun in this neck of the woods. Bizarrely it is pitch black until about 7.30 here when it suddenly becomes all brightness in a matter of seconds. This generally leaves us a little stunned and it isn\'t until I have had a few restorative coffees (and Lisette, teas) that life seems normal again - around about 10. So we hit the trails at about 11-12 (incidentally \\"Hopalong Reilly\\" really is on the mend and could now more aptly be dubbed \\"Mountain-Goat Reilly\\"). At this point the sun starts its full beam effects which tends to leave us panting at the side of the path wondering why we appear to be walking on our own. The reason is simple - everyone has finished walking at this point and is enjoying a leisurely lunch. We tend to hove into town around about 3-4ish absolutely drenched in sweat and waving empty water bottles in the hope of serious refreshment. And here is the miscalculation. One tradition that continues unabated in this part of the world is \\"siesta\\". Just as we arrive in town looking for sustenance all the shops close their doors, the restaurants stop serving and Lisette and I stagger round much in the manner of people who have just gone 10 rounds in a boxing ring and lost on points. ![](cin42.jpg)\\n\\n The restaurants all open again at approximately 7pm by which point we have often found our way home and promptly collapsed. No more do we venture out as we simply do not have the energy. Consequently it seems that an easy way to lose weight is to go on a \\"John and Lisette-style\\" walking holiday. Exhaustion guaranteed. Your only meal is breakfast.

As you can probably gather Lisette and i have been spending a lot of time on buses of late - we have been a little over ambitious with this holiday in that we are travelling pretty much from the bottom of Italy to the bottom of France. Unfortunately bad planning (on my behalf), strikes and changes in ideas have meant that we have found ourselves travelling all day for the last couple of days, finding somewhere to sleep at night and then repeating the pattern. Its a bit like one of those Jason Bourne films - just with less killing and only minor occasional identity changes. That said Lisette had a haircut in the hill town of Orvieto that she was very pleased with at the time - hair very curly and buoyant by the end. (Now alas flattened somewhat by the absence of good curling tongs and a freak rain shower) I have decided that the localising of place names is a mistake. London to an Italian is Londres. Firenze to an English speaker is Florence. Naples to an Italian is Napoli. The list continues... In my opinion all these extra alternatives are confusing and a waste of good words that could otherwise be put to good purpose. And we\'ve encountered at least one American that spent a full week circling central Italy in search of Florence... Speaking of other nationalities, we met our first ever Romanian one on the train (when the strike was over): Marion the Romanian Nurse - in fact we shared a rail carriage with Marion and an Italian family on the way up from Pisa. The name might mislead you into thinking that Marion is female - he is not. In fact Marion is an ex-construction worker with much the same build as a professional wrestler. Conversation with him was eye opening. Ever wondered why there are so many people from Eastern Europe (ie ex-Soviet Union countries) keen to get into England / Italy etc? Marions take on it was this: \\"So it (the USSR) finished and suddenly there are all these products in the shops from all over world instead of just all of the USSR. And the non-USSR products were much cheaper. So no-one buys the USSR products and all the USSR companies went bankrupt.\\" Consequently, Marion and his family at least had went looking for work where there were jobs - and in their case that meant Italy not Romania. We gave Marion the rundown on where we had been so far. Sorreto, sunny. Orvieto, medieval in a good way. Napoli horrible (we were only there for 2 hours but long enough to form an opinion). The Italian woman next to us (who was studiously not paying attention to us) notably snorted to herself at this point - presumably she agreed with us that Napoli was grim. Marion then decided to give us a bit of tourist advice and told us that in Sicily (where we were originally going) they were thieves and muggers. The Italian woman did not snort at this - not sure if Marion had just offended a Sicilian (for which he would no doubt pay if he was right) or if she simply agreed... See you soon!

We were assured by the book that it was an amazingly scenic and picturesque place. So it was. The slight (and unmentioned) quirk of Positano is that to get there one catches a bus. The buses weave a beautiful journey around some lovely coastline before finally dropping you at the side of the road. Once dropped off there appears to be nothing there at all - Positano doesn\'t appear to exist (Italys Brigadoon?). It is not until you look down that you identify the reason for this. Positano basically lives at the bottom of a sheer cliff face - it looks to the casual eye as though visiting is only possible for committed abseilers or parachutists.... After some rooting around we discovered that there was an alternative method of entry and that it was basically descending 9,999 steps. Maybe more. Naturally I had no fear of attempting this myself but I was worried for \\"Hopalong Reilly\\" (otherwise known as Lisette). Hopalong was still suffering from the foot injury obtained from dancing vigorously at David and Sarahs wedding. There was no real alternative though so over the period of about 2 hours Lisette and I descended (with many a yelp) into town. The happy discovery upon reaching town was that we could escape by boat rather than put my heart and Lisettes foot at risk on the re-ascent. Our journey home was consequently very scenic and was doubly improved by the fact that Lisette and I had managed to smuggle 2 restorative seafood pizzas onto the boat to sustain us. Think this irritated our fellow travellers though - jealousy is a terribly thing. By the way, for those wondering I havent forgotten how to use an apostrophe - I simply cant locate it on the Italian keyboard. Did devote some time to looking but at the end of the day it costs 6 euro an hour for the internet and so I have decided to put grammar (and no doubt spelling too) by the wayside. See you soon!

We both went for pizza and learned the first valuable lesson: \'Neopolitan\' means that you get a pizza \\\\***completely**\\\\* devoid of cheese! Apparently this is traditional but I was frankly disappointed when Lisettes pizza arrived without what I had personally always considered to be the traditional topping... Fortunately my own pizza was not lacking on this front and so between mouthfuls I was able to offer up my sympathies to Lisette (who was essentially eating ketchup on toast as far as I could tell). Lesson two was not so much pizza related as \'main square\' related and, as mentioned, we had a hunch on this one already. The bill arrived at the end of the meal and seemed somewhat larger than expected.

We actually spent most of our time in Merida going on trips to get out of Merida. And some of these trips were champion. I can now say that I\\\\`ve seen 24,000 flamingos in the flesh! (well more the pink feathers) To my surprise not one was standing on one leg. Was tempted to ask for half a refund. All were very pink indeed - we were told this has something to do with eating shrimp. Lisette and I have now reached our final destination before heading home. After 6 hours on buses yesterday watching \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" in Spanish (crap, by the way) we are in Puerto Morelos (back on the east coast of Mexico again). We\xb4re staying in the Amar Inn. Given our experience of the establishment I reckon that \\"Amar Inn\\" translates to English as something like \\"Home of the BIG BIG dogs\\". The place is a small B & B which is overrun with very large hounds - Great Danes a favourite. They\\\\`re very friendly too - the most friendly is a golden retriever that appears to be part bear, such are her dimensions. Her name, ironically, is \\"Blondie\\"... The man who runs the place is also rather bear-like - it\xb4s very possible that through his over-sized and over-muscled eyes she is but a cute yellow puppy - who can say? Lisette is very much in her element in Puerto Morelos as it contains the following: 1. Beach 2. Sun For me it\xb4s good as it contains: 1. Hammocks 2. Shade So as I seek shelter from the sun Lisette comes to visit me every hour or so. Last time I saw her she had managed a new first - she has managed to tan 95% of her body - the only exception being the tops of her feet which are about the same colour as lobster that has failed to escape from the machinations of an enthusiastic chef...

We were staying in a nice hotel (pictures of which you may have seen) which appeared to be populated mostly by retired Americans and student Americans (around the age of 18 and searching for countries with less stringent licensing laws). As mentioned previously, we\'ve been crashing early of an evening and so headed up the wooden hills to bedfordshire at about 8pm. The next thing we knew the world was erupting. It was dark outside as far as I could ascertain and we were very much in the company (separated only by a wall) of the American students. After listening to their output for about 5 minutes it seemed likely that they were attempting to make some kind of sequel to the 70\xb4s film \\"Animal House\\". Maybe \\"Animal House 2 - they\xb4re back and yet somehow less charming\\". Reasoning that interrupting them in their inebriated state would likely only lead to a difference of opinion Lisette and I decided that discretion was the better part of valour and vouched to take a midnight walk instead. A couple of minutes later, Lisette and I were in the square. Contrary to our expectations of a quiet walk the square was in full fiesta flow. A stage had been erected on one corner of the square and on it was a full band, multiple singers / dancers / drummers / horns - the list goes on! In the square itself the people of the town (from young to very old indeed) were dancing away in the midnight air. The noise was incredible. I can\xb4t really describe properly what it was like - loud, energetic, pulsing... Mexican?? We watched for some time and even ventured the odd move ourselves (well Lisette more than me in all honesty). There seemed no likelihood that they would ever stop playing and so after an hour or so we drifted back to our hotel. Felt like a very cultural evening though. ![](DSCF2688.JPG)\\n\\n Mexico appears to have no cats. Whereas cats wander the streets as if they own them at home there appear to be none here. In their place are dogs. Not dogs on leads pulling owners along after them. Rather dogs running free and begging for scraps - think \\"Tramp\\" - as in \\"Lady and the ....\\". However, we\xb4ve found an exception. We are now staying in Merida (not our favourite town - for reasons I won\xb4t bore you with) in an amazing b & b called the Casa Mexilio.

Now sit back and watch the cash roll in! :-) I can write this with some authority as Lisette and I have been staying in an eco-lodge (and staring with shock at various bills in the interim). We moved on from Isla Mujures on Monday. At this point I was still bagless and getting a little weary of the \\"wash clothes in sink before going to sleep\\" routine I\xb4d adopted for sanity\xb4s sake (and for that of the local air quality). When it came to checking out we decided to try our luck by phoning American Airlines one last time. Good news. Apparently, having finished its world tour, my bag had headed for Cancun and was waiting for me in the airport. Delighted, we breathlessly told AA that we were leaving our current hotel now and so they should deliver the bag to our new hotel - the Luna Maya in Tulum. AA confirmed that was fine. We asked the hotel staff of the \\"Maria Del Mar\\" to refuse our bag if it should be delivered by accident and we headed South to Tulum (via a half-hour boat-ride, a 2 hour coach-ride, 2 taxis and a bit of walking). About 6pm we arrived at our new hotel - sorry - eco-lodge to meet probably the surliest man in the eco-lodge business. We asked him if we could use the phone to ring AA. We didn\xb4t think this was too much of an imposition - it was a toll-free number after all. \\"No phone\\" he gruffly informed us. It seemed there were no lengths to which the penny-pinching of an eco-lodge would extend. After some unsuccessful attempts with our mobile phones we prevailed upon his good nature once more (clearly a desperate move). Glaring at us, he threw his mobile phone in our direction so we could make the call. AA told us that the bag was still \\"in-transit\\". The next morning my bag still hadn\xb4t shown - something of a mystery. Coupled with this, Tulum was absorbing the kind of rain that is usually reserved for Biblical floods. Lisette and I sought protection in an internet shop until the worst was over. To kill time we phoned AA once more - the bag was \\\\***still**\\\\* in transit. Still! Apparently having circumnavigated the globe by air it was now attempting a tour of Mexico by land... We checked our email and found this waiting for us: *RE: Baggage it\'s in Cabanas Maria del Mar.

Now that we\'ve got here I\'m increasingly of the opinion that we never should have left. Bologna seems somewhat industrial, hostile and - dare I say it - mugging territory. (For the more nervous of you I haven\'t actually seen direct evidence of this - it\'s just a feeling)\\n\\nWe pulled into town latish last night having caught the Eurostar from Firenze/Florence to make our journey. That in itself was a bit of a surprise - I was only aware of the Eurostar chugging along between Waterloo and Paris. Quite unexpected. Having arrived and hauled our stuff to the hotel we went for an evening saunter during which I made the following observations:\\n\\n1. There\'s a lot of cars\\n2. There\'s some dodgy looking blokes and a distinct absence of women travelling by themselves (in stark contrast to previous destinations)\\n3. The graffitti here is excessive and depressing.\\n\\n\x3c!-- --\x3e\\n\\nYou might think that observation 3 is a bit odd. Surely all grafitti is depressing? However that\'s not my opinion; I\'m highly in favour of the works of Banksy and the like. That said almost all grafitti is depressing. I don\'t wish to see another \\"Tox \'04\\",\\"Tox \'05\\", \\"Tox \'06\\" or \\"Tox \'07\\" \\\\*anywhere\\\\*. \\"Tox\\", in case you are wondering, is the tag of some London sort who wanders around scribbling his chosen moniker and the year in which it was done pretty much anywhere he can in London. I\'m not sure what he hopes to achieve by adding the year of defacement as a suffix to his tags. I can only assume that he genuinely believes he is an as yet unappreciated talent who\'s work will be toured by future art historians who will take great interest in the \\"progression\\" of his work. \\"Ah yes class, an \'06\' - truly the days when you can start to see Tox stretch himself. Note the positioning of this tag on a busy railway line. This would indeed have been quite a tricky spot to reach and great nerve would have been required in the execution of the \'tag\' itself...\\"\\n\\nI digress...\\n\\nAnyway - Tuscany on the whole is not without grafitti. However there is a relatively small amount of it and if you would credit it, it is actually rather poignant. For a start, it\'s not \\"tag\\" orientated. That is to say, there are actually things written which you can read rather than simple \\"tags\\". Secondly, and for no obvious reason, the grafitti is in English. I don\'t why - it just is. Finally, that which is written is actually quite interesting... occasionally even moving! Here\'s some of the things we found written:\\n\\n\\"Where is the happyness?\\" - written on the roof of a house in GIANT letters. We spied it from the top of a tower (we\'ve climbed quite a few towers this holiday...) \\"I don\'t want to be alone - do you?\\" \\"I\'ll remember you\\" - written on a wall in Lucce.\\n\\n![](DSCF2076.JPG)\\n\\n![](Image110.jpg)\\n\\nStirring sentiments don\'t you think? You could almost join together the different entries to form a story. Sad man is very lonely. Declaims \\"Where is the happiness?\\" to the empty world, emphasising further his solitary existence. Sad man meets someone passing through town and they get talking. After they\'ve got to know each other a little, perhaps had a drink to reduce the inhibitions, the sad man opens up and says \\"I don\'t want to be alone - do you?\\". A friendship (maybe a romance?) begins between the two - the sad man is not sad anymore. Finally the other (whoever it may be) has to move on for whatever reason. The man (no longer sad) says to the other before they leave: \\"I\'ll remember you\\". A beautiful story... don\'t you think? I reckon there\'s a film in there somewhere...\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnyhow Lisette and I are doing our level best in the interim to avoid Bologna. Today we\'re visiting nearby Modena (home of Pavarotti and Balsamic vinegar) which is very charming. And tomorrow we move on to Lake Garda - about which we\'ve heard very good things indeed.\\n\\nSee you all soon!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n![](DSCF2367.JPG)"},{"id":"oh-i-wish-i-spoke-spanish","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/oh-i-wish-i-spoke-spanish","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2006-08-08-oh-i-wish-i-spoke-spanish/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2006-08-08-oh-i-wish-i-spoke-spanish/index.md","title":"Oh I wish I spoke Spanish...","description":"Because then I wouldn\'t feel so bad....","date":"2006-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.78,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Reilly","url":"https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly","imageURL":"https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg","key":"johnnyreilly","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Oh I wish I spoke Spanish...","authors":"johnnyreilly","tags":[],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"slug":"oh-i-wish-i-spoke-spanish","image":"./hon3bocosus2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Avoid Bologna - Tuscany is better!!","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/avoid-bologna-tuscany-is-better"},"nextItem":{"title":"Everybody hurts...","permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/everybody-hurts"}},"content":"Because then I wouldn\'t feel so bad....\\n\\n3 weeks in and we\'re feeling the pain of not being able to communicate. Last night we went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner (in Bocas del Toro - where we\'ve been for 3 days now). I don\'t think anyone in the establishment actually was Chinese but that\'s still what it called itself.\\n\\nThe menu was presented and as with Chinese places the world over we were presented with a menu which was comparable in size to the complete works of Shakespeare. Not to be defeated we ordered some beers (we have at least learned the phrase \\"cevesa\\" during our travels). Further study of the menu didn\'t really render much hope apart from the fact that I identified \\"chow mein\\" which I thought might make a nice side dish to share. When the waitress came we decided to chance it and order with our fingers crossed....\\n\\nThis was a mistake.\\n\\nWhen the meal finally came we discovered we had ordered the following:\\n\\n- Strange crisps - sort of the Panamanian/Chinese answer to poppadoms I can only assume\\n- Spring rolls - traditionally these are filled with beansprouts and other things. In this part of the world bean-sprouts are hard to come by and so the Panamians are using a bean-sprout alternative: cabbage. I don\'t consider it an unqualified success\\n- Beef with rice noodles - a slightly bland main course for Lisette\\n- Chow mein to share - but after a mouthful I decided it was better to leave it\\n- A plate of fried rice. This was my main course. I distinctly heard the waitress cackling with laughter to herself as she strolled off. (\\"No tip for her\\", I thought at the time)\\n\\n\x3c!-- --\x3e\\n\\nDepression and determination arrived in equal measure as I determined to eat the plate of fried rice. However, after many a forkful I finally had to admit defeat ... It was that or be riced to death. What a way to go.\\n\\nWe\'re now off to stay in our \\"eco-lodge\\" for 2 nights - out in the middle of nowhere!\\n\\nIt\'ll definitely be a change from Bocas town which is essentially full to bursting with young Americans ever in search of an \\"alternative lifestyle\\" - mostly expressed in the form of beads, bongos and piercings in unusual places. They have managed to furnish me with a second wooden wedding ring though (to replace the one that went under the bus in David). It \'s a little on the unusual side this new wedding ring - it\'s in the style traditionally worn by \\"Ming the Merciless\\" (all you Flash Gordon fans). Though the I should say that the outlandish style of my new ring does not appear to have intimidated Lisette in any way - as yet....\\n\\nIn fact it\'s quite a nice town - particularly if you like dogs. (I do!) There are many many dogs that leisurely stroll the streets here, occasionally pausing to beg for food, stretch or scratch for fleas... There\'s one in the hostel where we\'re staying that sleeps underneath the sofa. It\'s also a nice town if you like vultures. Huge ungainly birds that stroll the roads looking like huge threatening bald ravens. I haven\'t seen them picking at any carcasses as yet - perhaps they live off rejected chow mein from the Chinese restaurant...\\n\\nTake care people!\\n\\nJohn and Lisette\\n\\n![](hon3bocosus2.jpg)"},{"id":"everybody-hurts","metadata":{"permalink":"/reillys-on-tour/everybody-hurts","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2006-08-02-everybody-hurts/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2006-08-02-everybody-hurts/index.md","title":"Everybody hurts...","description":"Heard that song? Well that\xb4s me (and Lisette) right now We signed ourselves up to do some white water rafting yesterday with a dutch girl in our hostel called Petri. The people doing the organising told us that the river was somewhere between the \\"6th and the 9th most dangerous in the world\\" ..... but that due to favourable weather conditions and rainfall recently \\"we should be fine\\". A little worried but still confident we signed up and set off early the next morning. It was at this point our guide started telling us things like \\"if you get caught underwater you should consider whether you want to die or break a bone to get free\\". Marvellous. By the time we actually got in the water it was with a large number of reservations and no small amount of fear. These fears seemed quite well justified once we\xb4d been through the first couple of rapids and come fairly close to drowning. It was at this point I noticed that the strap that was supposed to anchor my left foot to the boat was missing... And that I was developing cramp in my left leg as I furiously held fast to the side of the dinghy for dear life... But I\xb4ll not over-egg this story - we survived. We got sunburned. We got eaten by mosquitoes. We drank plenty of river water. We fell in the river. We were thrown in the river (our guides could be politely described as \\"mischievous\\"). We got scratched, bruised and battered.... but miraculously we didn\xb4t die or suffer extensive injuries! But we hurt so much. It\xb4s now about 24 hours since we finished and I feel I\xb4ve aged about 70 years. I know what it\xb4s like to be old now. I\xb4ve had the sneak preview. Ouch. On the plus side we have at least picked a good spot in which to recuperate. Having spent our first 48 hours in Panama comparing the place to Gotham City on a dark night we have now reach a very pleasant spot. It\xb4s like a Swiss mountain town but without the Swiss. It\xb4s a village high up in the Western Panamanian hills called Boquete. I highly recommend it! \xcdt\xb4s coffee country and we\xb4ve toured a nearby coffee plantation and done a coffee tasting session. My sanity is definitely returning!

Well that\xb4s me (and Lisette) right now We signed ourselves up to do some white water rafting yesterday with a dutch girl in our hostel called Petri. The people doing the organising told us that the river was somewhere between the \\"6th and the 9th most dangerous in the world\\" ..... but that due to favourable weather conditions and rainfall recently \\"we should be fine\\". A little worried but still confident we signed up and set off early the next morning. It was at this point our guide started telling us things like \\"if you get caught underwater you should consider whether you want to die or break a bone to get free\\". Marvellous. By the time we actually got in the water it was with a large number of reservations and no small amount of fear. These fears seemed quite well justified once we\xb4d been through the first couple of rapids and come fairly close to drowning. It was at this point I noticed that the strap that was supposed to anchor my left foot to the boat was missing... And that I was developing cramp in my left leg as I furiously held fast to the side of the dinghy for dear life... But I\xb4ll not over-egg this story - we survived. We got sunburned. We got eaten by mosquitoes. We drank plenty of river water. We fell in the river. We were thrown in the river (our guides could be politely described as \\"mischievous\\"). We got scratched, bruised and battered.... but miraculously we didn\xb4t die or suffer extensive injuries! But we hurt so much. It\xb4s now about 24 hours since we finished and I feel I\xb4ve aged about 70 years. I know what it\xb4s like to be old now. I\xb4ve had the sneak preview. Ouch. On the plus side we have at least picked a good spot in which to recuperate. Having spent our first 48 hours in Panama comparing the place to Gotham City on a dark night we have now reach a very pleasant spot. It\xb4s like a Swiss mountain town but without the Swiss. It\xb4s a village high up in the Western Panamanian hills called Boquete. I highly recommend it! \xcdt\xb4s coffee country and we\xb4ve toured a nearby coffee plantation and done a coffee tasting session. My sanity is definitely returning!

Despite that we packed in some fun-filled adventures: 1. we explored \\"Old San Juan\\" - a very picturesque place\\n2. we hiked through a rainforest\\n3. we went to the Bacardi factory where they make all the rum - essentially this was one big advert in the name of Bacardi but the drinks were free... Shame I don\xb4t like rum\\n\\n\x3c!-- --\x3e\\n\\n Now some of you may know that Lisette and I decided not to take our wedding rings with us when we went away in case they were lost or (more worryingly) stolen. But rather than travel \\"ring-less\\" we hooked ourselves up with some wooden wedding rings - well to be more accurate Lisette wore her wooden engagement ring and I bought myself a 3 dollar wooden ring which I was really rather taken with. We caught the plane last night to Panama and landed about 7pm. We caught a taxi from the airport to where we were staying that night in Panama City - an area called \\"Condida\\". The hotel looked a lot worse than it had in the picture I saw when booking. The room was the very definition of \\"barren\\" - basic furniture, curtains that wouldn\xb4t open, windows that wouldn\xb4t open, no hot water. All in all, a bit depressing. So, to lift our spirits, we decided to go out to dinner. After 3 minutes of walking we\xb4d realised that we didn\xb4t like the neighbourhood that much. No streetlights, bars on every door and window, worrying people looming in the distance - scary. It\xb4s worth bearing in mind that I lived happily in Brixton for 4 years or so - an area that many don\xb4t regard as salubrious. This place made Brixton look like Butlins with balloons. I\xb4d like to tell you that things improved in the clear light of morning. They did not. It\xb4s some measure of the way we now feel about Panama City that we consider it\xb4s probably unsafe to wear even the wooden wedding rings now. And in fact we have decided to cut and run. I type this missive from inside the Gran Terminal bus station just outside Panama City. We\xb4ve got tickets for the 2215 overnight bus to David (pronounced Dah-veed). We\xb4re leaving and we\xb4re not coming back. Consider this an all points bulletin on Panama City - if you have any love of life and love of self then I recommend you avoid this place like the plague. We were lied to by the travel book - we can only hope that Boquette (where we go after David) is an improvement on this. I do have high hopes - it is coffee country and apparently we can visit the plantations.... fingers crossed!
