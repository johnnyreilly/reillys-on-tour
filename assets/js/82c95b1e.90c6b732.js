Looking out as the sun rose above the Loire while we breakfasted I wrote a poem!

The bike was rented from a shop that was 50% cycle shop and 50% wine cellar. Not clear if the guy that owns it was looking to serve the same market with both products - feel that could be a poor business plan on the road safety front... The chateaux was mighty impressive - and I believe it may have been used as the basis for Herg\xe8s Captain Haddocks mansion? Day concluded at the "Bigot Patisserie". No sign of Nick Griffin, presume that "Bigot" has some innocent English translation. Either that or the shop is owned by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Bon Soir, John and Lisette PS Saw a comic book this morning entitled "Sarkozy et Les Femmes" on the front of which was a sleazy looking dwarf-sized representation of the French President surrounded by women towering over him.
