For clarity, let me say that this is not some sly dig, rather, if you are from Crete, it turns out you are a "Cretan". As a lady named Cassandra explained "yes, we know what it sounds like, but that is what we are".

The wedding was set to officially start at 7pm. Back home, 1pm would be more typical. But as we sweated our way through 38 degrees that day, the logic of the start time became undeniable. If it  had started at 1pm, we'd be passing out in our suits by 1:15."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The entire wedding took place outdoors. Coming from a country where it rains half of the time, and a further quarter of the time it looks like the weather is considering a dowsing, it seemed inconceivable to have an entirely outdoor wedding. And yet that's what it was. The service took place in a large courtyard with a chapel in the centre. The reception took place in a garden under the open sky."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The nature of the service was different as well. In the UK, you show up at a church.

But what is a given, is that all eyes are on the ceremony."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In Crete, it's a little different. There's a few chairs laid out, but these aren't for everyone, more for those who really need to sit. Everyone else stands around at varying distances from the ceremony that is taking place. And there's a lot more people. So many that if you're further back, you probably don't really know what's going on. And that appeared to be fine. In fact, for some people it seemed that whilst they were happy to be here for the wedding, paying close attention to the ceremony was not necessarily high on their list of priorities. They weren't exactly second screening the wedding; rather it was more like \"yes there's a wedding, but there's other things happening too - I haven't seen this guy in, oooh, weeks!\""}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The wedding service was conducted in, I assume, Greek. Whatever happened, I didn't really understand it. It was, as they say, \"all Greek to me\".

To my great surprise, he appeared to be the older brother from another mother of one of the curates of my own church back in Twickenham.

He pondered it may actually be him in future, suggesting he has some knowledge of time travel and flexibility in theology which hadn't hitherto come through in his sermons."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Hurling of confetti or rice is something that appears to be shared across the cultures. Towards the end of the ceremony, a large bowl of rice went around the crowd, from which everyone took a handful. Someone said the Greek equivalent of "at my signal, unleash hell" and the bridal party, who were processing around the table where the service was conducted, began to be pelted with the hard rain of uncooked rice. What started as entertainment to me, mutated into genuine concern. The rice being used was risotto style and the grains were quite circular. I feared if we were using basmati we could have had someone\'s eye out. The priest had wisely decided that the magnificent Bible being used in the ceremony, could do double duty as a makeshift umbrella. Not his first rodeo.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"The couple and the priest rounding the table whilst being pelted with rice",src:a(1825).A+"",width:"1600",height:"1200"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With the ceremony complete, the wedding moved into a large garden and the eating and drinking began.

It was dark by now, and we couldn't always tell what we were eating. But it was great. We ate more. Then more. Curiously, we hadn't eaten any lamb. Unless it was disguised perhaps?

It's lamb which has been roasted, and rice and pasta which has been cooked in the stock of the lamb, with lemons. It's kind of a brothy risotto and it is fantastic.

I think it was called Antikristo."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We tried a forkful. It was exceptional. Such a shame then that there was no way we could have much more. In the end, we sat there staring at the meat, occasionally stirring and chopping and consuming a mouthful. Each time it was a reminder that a mouthful was too much. We couldn't eat more. We felt meat guilt as they belatedly took away plates which must have contained nearly the same amount of meat as they arrived with."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We heard, some days later, that the uneaten food was not wasted, and will have been eaten over the next week or so by the family. I'm writing this a week later, so I'd say by now that Eleni's family have reached peak lamb, passed through it, and are now making resolutions to never eat lamb again. Well, until the next wedding at least."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Main courses out of the way, the wedding turned to dancing. There was a traditional Cretan dancing display lead by a troupe of dancers in costume .

No doubt I\'m doing them a disservice with that description.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Towards the end of their display, everyone was invited onto the dancefloor to do some traditional dances. I think "Zorba the Greek" may have featured as part of this. Bruce, Kirsty and a variety of other family members headed to the dancefloor to get involved in the action. There was swaying and linking of arms, and also a conga. I would have joined in, but recent back issues meant I had to appreciate from the sidelines instead.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The male members of the family were all gifted traditional Cretan wedding scarves called \"sarikis\".

If the speech was good that is."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Peter had evidently decided that his role in the wedding was to bring a UK tradition to bear. A noble aspiration. "Dominic is a beautiful man, beautiful inside and out..." he intoned. So far so good, though he seemed to be going toe to toe with Donald Trump in his love of the word "beautiful".

He offered an appreciation of the dancing that we had seen thus far, and that he'd like to perform his own dance for the bride and groom. It would be great to report that I took the moment to look in their direction and gauge a response. But to honest, it was hard to look away from Peter at this point. Slow motion car crashes are undeniably compelling."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The DJ put on some kind of dance track and Peter, taking the whole dancefloor to himself, proceeded to vibrate with energy as he danced. If the guests weren\'t surprised enough by what was taking place, his regularly dropping in the breakdance move "the worm", which involved hurling his whole body forwards onto the ground, wriggling and propelling himself back upright, certainly impressed them. By the end of the song the audience applauded wildly.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At the last Greek wedding I'd attended, I discovered a university friend had a significant alcohol problem.\nIt seemed almost appropriate at this wedding to discover that my brother Peter was making every effort to appear he may be ploughing a similar furrow.

Upon reflection, I am drawing an ungenerous parallel."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Meanwhile, Peter had clearly had the time of his life.

Late in the evening, Eleni threw her bouquet into the crowd. And, as luck would have it, the best man, Dominic\'s brother Patrick, caught it. He was delighted.  His boyfriend Luke, was perhaps best described as "startled" as Patrick cackled like a mad thing.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Elsewhere, the younger children were now exhausted. Accustomed to being in bed by 9pm, they now found themselves dressed in suits, stuffed with food and drink, and still awake at 1 in the morning. The wedding was due to run until at least 3am. Our youngest boy James occasionally lay on the ground and gave a thousand yard stare to all around him. At this, parental guilt broke in.
