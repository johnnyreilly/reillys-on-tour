So far we have: - Eaten some very hot food - proper "crikey-get me water" curries. Experienced some very hot and humid weather. - Been out on a boat at dawn watching a variety of dolphins hurl themselves out of the water like so many grey-skinned teenagers doing skateboard tricks - Travelled round several of the "most important archeological monuments in the world" (Asangha\'s words) - Inspected a number of "eighth wonders of the world" (also Asangha\'s words... hmmm) - Travelled from the coast of Sri Lanka to Habarana in the steep hill country. And it\'s in this last point that lies the rub. It has occurred to me that I have become a prisoner of circumstance. Lisette, I, (and the tour-ees / tour-ettes) are holed up in a hotel in Habarana. There is nothing in Habarana - it\'s a one-elephant town. Normally, Lisette and I like to get out and explore. See what the town has to offer. Go for a meal etc. Can\'t do any of that. So we\'re kind of stuck either doing stuff on the tour or stuck on hotel grounds. Not that it\'s an unpleasant hotel. It\'s kind of like a "nice" version of a World War II Prisoner-of-War camp. (Hence my allusions to the Great Escape - not too sure who Lisette would be in that scenario so lets skate over my inaccurate analogies). As well as this, we are caused to rise very early every morning to "get the best of the day". Tomorrow we\'re up at 5:30am. Today we were up at 6:30am. The day before yesterday we were up at 4am. Not quite my bag baby. So not sure yet if tours are "us".
