We were staying in a nice hotel (pictures of which you may have seen) which appeared to be populated mostly by retired Americans and student Americans (around the age of 18 and searching for countries with less stringent licensing laws). As mentioned previously, we\'ve been crashing early of an evening and so headed up the wooden hills to bedfordshire at about 8pm. The next thing we knew the world was erupting. It was dark outside as far as I could ascertain and we were very much in the company (separated only by a wall) of the American students. After listening to their output for about 5 minutes it seemed likely that they were attempting to make some kind of sequel to the 70\xb4s film "Animal House". Maybe "Animal House 2 - they\xb4re back and yet somehow less charming". Reasoning that interrupting them in their inebriated state would likely only lead to a difference of opinion Lisette and I decided that discretion was the better part of valour and vouched to take a midnight walk instead. A couple of minutes later, Lisette and I were in the square. Contrary to our expectations of a quiet walk the square was in full fiesta flow. A stage had been erected on one corner of the square and on it was a full band, multiple singers / dancers / drummers / horns - the list goes on! In the square itself the people of the town (from young to very old indeed) were dancing away in the midnight air. The noise was incredible. I can\xb4t really describe properly what it was like - loud, energetic, pulsing... Mexican?? We watched for some time and even ventured the odd move ourselves (well Lisette more than me in all honesty). There seemed no likelihood that they would ever stop playing and so after an hour or so we drifted back to our hotel. Felt like a very cultural evening though.

Whereas cats wander the streets as if they own them at home there appear to be none here. In their place are dogs. Not dogs on leads pulling owners along after them. Rather dogs running free and begging for scraps - think "Tramp" - as in "Lady and the ....". However, we\xb4ve found an exception. We are now staying in Merida (not our favourite town - for reasons I won\xb4t bore you with) in an amazing b & b called the Casa Mexilio. The only 3 cats in Mexico live here. And at night Casa Mexilio becomes Catfight Club. We wake up about 4 or 5 times a night to catch the most interesting bits. A "Wroooooooowwwwlllll" indicating that Ginger has Mr Tiddles in a headlock.
