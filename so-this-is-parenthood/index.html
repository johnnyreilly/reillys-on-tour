I realised the other day that many things were happening. Each day there are changes; every morning something is different. And so I wanted to note down where we are, what&#x27;s happened, how we feel, what it&#x27;s been like.</p>
<p>First let&#x27;s take a look at the little man:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/reillys-on-tour/assets/images/P1060654+again-10d8ae59ae17dfd24a676ee511a90ad4.JPG" width="400" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Now I know I&#x27;m biased but isn&#x27;t he gorgeous? I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Lisette and I have become that which we despised: parents that dote on their progeny. We&#x27;re wondering if he might have ginger hair. Looks a bit that way. And do notice his tongue. That tongue was the cause of a lot of trouble.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-breast-things-in-life-are-free">The Breast Things in Life are Free<a href="#the-breast-things-in-life-are-free" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Breast Things in Life are Free" title="Direct link to The Breast Things in Life are Free">​</a></h2>
<p>After the lad was born we&#x27;d been told by other parents that the first 3 days can be quite tough. Or rather that after 3 days you&#x27;ve run out of adrenalin and you&#x27;ll be running on empty. We were. Feeding was not going well at this point. Lisette was absolutely shattered and Benjamin was pretty demanding.</p>
<p>Now this may shock you but I hadn&#x27;t thought much about breast-feeding up until this point in my life. I kind of assumed it just worked, natures lactic taps were miraculously turned on post-birth. Not so. Or at least it didn&#x27;t seem to be plain sailing in Lisette&#x27;s case. There was a lot of drama as different feeding positions were tried out (under-arm being the most successful). There was unquestionably a phenomenal amount of pain involved for Lisette. And the lad wasn&#x27;t happy. He screamed. A lot. We were worried.</p>
<p>We were visited by a number of healthcare visitors and also by Mandy (continuing in the good egg stakes). The cult of breast-feeding quickly became apparent. The advice was nothing if not, well, consistent. &quot;Breast-feed, breast-feed, breast-feed.&quot; It&#x27;s hard? Tough. The kid&#x27;s unhappy? Ignore it.</p>
<p>Babies weights are supposed to dip after birth. And there&#x27;s an acceptable percentage by which their weights can dip. Benjamin dipped. And dipped. And dipped some more. However, we didn&#x27;t actually know that this was the case at first. It emerged that maths was not the forte of the health visitors. They&#x27;d calculated that Benjamin had lost the acceptable percentage of his weight and so he was fine. We should continue as is. But as it turned out their sums were wrong; Benjamin had actually lost rather more weight than they calculated. He was unsurprisingly a little hungry.</p>
<p>It was Mandy that observed &quot;he&#x27;s a little floppy&quot; on one of her visits. She lowered her voice and leaned forward. &quot;You could try topping him up.&quot; So we did. Mandy had suggested that giving Benjamin a bottle probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea as it might stop him breastfeeding entirely. Fair enough. So instead we would put tiny amounts of formula milk into a beaker and mid-scream (all he ever seemed to do at this point was scream) we would hurl the liquid down his throat. And repeat.</p>
<p>It felt like the oddest thing to be doing - but it worked. Benjamin settled. And screamed a little less.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cat-got-your-tongue">Cat Got Your Tongue?<a href="#cat-got-your-tongue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cat Got Your Tongue?" title="Direct link to Cat Got Your Tongue?">​</a></h2>
<p>Apparently breast-feeding is supposed to hurt initially. But after that it&#x27;s supposed to ease up. So a month later Lisette was quite distraught to still be finding it so painful. Each time she started feeding Benjamin there would be that clamping-on noise of Benjamin getting purchase followed by a yowl of pain from Lisette. Bit puzzling that.</p>
<p>The health visitors seemed unconcerned. I don&#x27;t think they were thrilled we were topping Benjamin up with formula but they were at least pleased Lisette was persevering with the breast-feeding (despite the cost to her sanity). I returned home from work one day to have this conversation:</p>
<p>&quot;So, Lucy thinks Benjamin&#x27;s got a tongue tie.&quot; &quot;A tongue tie?&quot; &quot;It means his tongue is stuck to the bottom of his mouth. Her Freddie had one.&quot; &quot;Is that bad?&quot; &quot;It means he can&#x27;t feed properly, it hurts feeding for me, he&#x27;ll have problems gaining weight and he&#x27;ll have speech issues later in life&quot; &quot;So that&#x27;s a tentative &#x27;yes&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>You probably see where this is going... As it turned out, Lucy had been right. Benjamin did have a tongue-tie. And soon enough Lisette found herself in the waiting room to get it fixed up. I was quite surprised to discover just medieval the procedure seemed to be. I&#x27;m not too sure how I expected them to proceed but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be a question of sticking surgical scissors under his tongue and snipping whilst he was awake...</p>
<p>But ours not to reason why and for what it&#x27;s worth it seemed to be a glorious success! Benjamin is now feeding much more successfully and as you can see from his picture he particularly enjoys sticking his tongue out as he smiles!</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/reillys-on-tour/tags/breast-feeding">Breast-feeding</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/reillys-on-tour/tags/tongue-tie">tongue tie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2012-10-11-so-this-is-parenthood/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/reillys-on-tour/mum-and-dads-40th-wedding-anniverary"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Mum and Dad&#x27;s 40th Wedding Anniverary</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/reillys-on-tour/unto-us-son-is-given"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Unto us a son is given...</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#the-breast-things-in-life-are-free" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Breast Things in Life are Free</a></li><li><a href="#cat-got-your-tongue" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Cat Got Your Tongue?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 John Reilly.
