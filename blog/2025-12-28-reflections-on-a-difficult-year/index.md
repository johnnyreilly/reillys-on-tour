The year is coming to a close. My mind is no longer deep in work. Rather I find things moving slowly as we live through another Christmas. The Reilly family Christmas tree has long been up, and, as you walk the streets of London, everywhere is lit by the magic of fairy lights.

This year has been very difficult for me. I have not had the year I expected to. It has been different. Something quite terrifying and horrible. But also, laced with humanity. I wanted to take some time to write it down. Often when I write, I'm trying to make the people reading smile. I am not, on this occasion. This is John in sincere mode.

## Warning signs

In January, I travelled to Mumbai for work. I earn my bread as a software engineer for Investec, and we have an office there full of delightful people. On this particular trip I noticed an odd feeling in my right leg. It distracted and irritated me. Enough that for at least one night I had to turn in early as it was difficult to be around people whilst my right leg, and bizarrely my right buttock, twinged.

But it passed. Enough that we went out dancing on our last night in Mumbai, to which I gave my all. Dancing is one of the joys of life. To hurl yourself around a dancefloor with ridiculous enthusiasm is to feel alive. So I must have been feeling better. Getting back to England I then went to a friend's 40th birthday, and again danced wildly. I rarely feel more me, and connected with the human race than when on a dance floor. It's such a feeling of joy and gay abandon.

After that, I felt fine for a while. A bit achy, but then I'm not 20 anymore. But otherwise great. Time passed.

Then came Easter. As I often have done, I volunteered to help with the holiday club that runs at my church. This involved a certain amount of sitting on wooden floors; nothing I hadn't done before. However, the pain and irritation with my right leg and my right buttock was back and it was persistent. I couldn't shake it off.

## Making a bad thing worse

I battled on. Life was uncomfortable, but I wasn't sure what else to do. I kept going to work, I kept doing things with my family. I was persistently uncomfortable. I had a vague notion it might be connected with my back and so I started doing things like using a standing desk at work. As a software engineer, I've spent most of my life sitting down and that's not great for the back I came to understand.

I mentioned how much I like dancing. I also like cycling. And somewhere along the line, in the pandemic I believe, I had started cycling to work. Not always. I was and remain a fair weather cyclist. I'm strictly in it for the larks. So I would cycle to work quite regularly between April and October each year; when it was warm and light enough in the UK to make that fun.

It's fifteen miles from Twickenham to the City of London the route I cycle. My destination sits between St Pauls Cathedral and the Bank of England. Along I'd go, following the River Thames along towpaths with a backpack on containing a change of clothes and a heavy MacBook Pro. Oh and the charger for it that is easily another kilogramme. On my back.

I've been doing this for years, and had come to regard it as one of the great pleasures of life. And something that probably improved my health. When I set out in April, for the first time that year, I'd be wheezing and near collapse by the time I got to work. Come October, I was practiced and the ride was a breeze.

So, with my slightly painful leg and buttock, I decided to strap the backpack to my back and cycle to work on Thursday 1st May. At the end of the day I cycled home. This is where it all started to go wrong.

## Hell

I got home and my leg and right buttock hurt. Not a lot, but the discomfort didn't ease. It rose over time. I slept. Over Friday, it got worse. It kept getting worse. I was getting scared.

On Saturday morning, I woke. The pain was unbearable. I couldn't stand. I couldn't sit. No matter what I did, I was in pain. It's my habit to wake early and to go for a walk around the River Thames, near where I live. I thought I'd try and do that. I couldn't.

I found I could limp for about three paces, before I would need to crouch down on the ground and breathe deeply. Maybe I made it thirty metres from my front door before I realised I couldn't go any further. I struggled back to my house, again alternately limping and crouching, until I reached the front door. Inside I collapsed on a sofa. Then I cried.

It wasn't an "I'm sad" cry, although I certainly was that. It was more an automatic reaction by my body. I was experiencing a level of pain that I didn't think was possible. Something I'd never felt before. I had no space for anything other than tears. I've never felt anything like it. My family found me downstairs sobbing. Wracked with pain, but with no way to relieve it. It was, and I mean this entirely literally, unbearable. I couldn't cope with it. I couldn't rationalise it. All I could do was react to it.

And it didn't stop. What now?

## The drugs don't work

I can say with some level of accuracy what happened to me around this time, as I'd started keeping a "back pain diary". Data is useful. I wanted to get better, and I knew that having data on my situation over time might help. So day by day I'd record my pain level out of 10 (at this point it was mostly "10/10") and where the pain presented.

I needed help. Time for some chemicals. After a night in which I barely slept, and I instead used much of the night looking at reviews for the A&E departments of local hospitals, I booked an Uber. It was to take me to the hospital that looked like the best bet from an A&E review perspective. Charing Cross hospital in Hammersmith.

I winced as the car accelerated and decelerated through London streets. Each movement was agony. When we arrived I had to manoeuvre myself out of the vehicle, experiencing shooting pain up and down my right leg as I adjusted position. I limped into the hospital. Some time later, shortly after a nurse had bluntly told me to "stop crying", I left again with a pocket full of top strength codeine.

It might as well have been Smarties. Over the next days I was to take medication which had warning messages on the packaging about how long I could take it, and find it did absolutely nothing to improve my situation. In fact the side effects, which I won't dwell upon, gave me additional problems to deal with.

The doctor wasn't able to say for sure, but they suspected I had sciatica. That discs in my spine were poking into my sciatic nerve and hurting me. Nerves are "noisy" when they're disturbed it seems.

Things were bad. And about to get worse.

## I can't get no sleep

Up until this point, the one relief I had in my life was bedtime. I would go to bed, close my eyes and sleep would remove me from the permanent experience of pain until my eyes opened again.

But now I couldn't sleep anymore. Going to bed became a horrible game where each position was so filled with pain, I had to move in the hope it would improve when I adjusted. But each movement gave no relief. Just more pain. I could never get to sleep.

Gradually I lost my grip on reality. Supposedly Lenin said "Every society is three meals away from chaos". My version would be "Every human is three sleeps away from derangement". I was no longer coherent. I spent much of my time furiously googling my symptoms. And let me tell you, that's a bad idea.

It was at this point I decided that I'd probably developed a condition that might require serious surgery. Somehow I got myself on the District Line and headed back towards hospital. I sat in my seat, with tears rolling down my cheeks as the tube rolled towards Hammersmith. I typed out this message to some local friends as I went, and it well sums up my mental state at the time:

[![WhatsApp message which says: Please forgive the slightly dramatic message. I am on may way to Charing cross hospital with symptoms that suggest potential Cauda Equina Syndrome. I'm quite scared and sad. I believe many of you pray. If you could I ask you to pray for me I would like that. Thanks](./whatsapp-message.png)](./whatsapp-message.png)

I was in a bad head space. In hospital they told me I didn't have what I suspected and this was probably still sciatica. But they could see that lack of sleep had left me discombobulated. I ended up with new painkillers, alas they were to prove as effective as the last, and something to put me to sleep. Thank you God, this did work. That night I slept for the first time in a while. With that, I managed to regain some level of rationality.

## Motion is lotion

I was still struggling with walking. I limped consistently, and I struggled to make much distance on foot.

My wife Lisette made an astute observation. "John, you're normally always moving, always doing something. But now you're just still. Maybe you should move?"

What followed was the most curious walk of my life. Lisette and I went out for an evening walk. Or as close as I could get to one. I would walk three paces, then crouch on the ground breathing deeply, recovering. Once I thought I could face it I would struggle to my feet with Lisette's help and battle on another three paces, then sink to the ground once again. We continued in this vein for an hour and a half. We covered maybe 400 metres.

At the end of the walk I was still in excruciating pain. However, I was moving easier than I had been. Not by much, but slightly.

The next morning I resolved to take myself out for a walk. Again I was staggering, crouching, staggering and crouching. But after I'd been going for an hour, I had a sensation of movement. I could walk much more freely. Still limping, still in pain, but walking without needing to crouch and huff and puff.

This was the first real sense of improvement I'd experienced. After what felt like an infinity of time in which my situation had gradually got worse, and worse, it was a great relief to feel something positive.

## Progress, setbacks and making changes

If this was a movie, at this point you'd see a calendar with dates whipping off it to denote the passing of time. My back pain diary daily reported that each day was much the same as the last, and maybe week by week the level of pain I was experiencing was perhaps slightly reducing.

It was tedious, but it was progress. Though if I'm honest, it often didn't feel like progress. I'm not a patient man.

To aid my recovery I was seeing a physiotherapist, who gave me various exercises to do. Lots of stretching. Many exercises involved performing frankly embarrassing movements which were supposed to "floss the nerves". I must have presented an odd appearance to my family members as they encountered me on the landing at home, where I would be doing these exercises.

Things were going better. I went to a family wedding. I had a good summer, by this time I wasn't so much dealing with pain as lack of feeling in my right foot and leg that came and went. My diagnosis of sciatica was confirmed. Please admire the MRI of my spine with prolapsed discs:

[![MRI showing prolapsed discs](./spine-mri.jpg)](./spine-mri.jpg)

Come September, things seemed to be going quite well. My body, clearly thinking I hadn't suffered enough, picked this point for a relapse.

After a weekend of driving uphill and down dale in the Peak District, I had a couple of days of feeling strange and not quite right in the back / leg. Then I collapsed in front of the fridge.

I'm not exaggerating. As I stood in front of the fridge at 11 in the morning, the extreme pain, the 10/10 sort came roaring back and I found myself lying on the ground in my kitchen.

What followed was both aggravating and perhaps encouraging. Aggravating for obvious reasons. Encouraging because unlike the previous occasion which had taken days until I could move more freely, this time I found myself at 5pm the same day being able to move. In a lot of pain, but able to move. So whilst it sucked that the sciatica had staged a comeback, it was reduced strength. Something I ascribed to the physio work I had been doing.

I decided to double down on improving my physical health. I'd lived most of my life doing nothing to actively help my physical health. With the exception of a morning walk and summer cycling to work, both of which I did because I enjoyed them, I did nothing else.

This was to change. Alongside the physio, I started doing "physical training" sessions and going to the gym. Having long wondered what all the fuss was about, I also signed myself up for pilates. Whilst the gym / PT was pretty much what I'd expected it to be, pilates was not. It turns out to be a combination of breathing, "engaging your core" (I didn't know I had one) and performing small physical motions which should be easy. And aren't.

I can gradually feel it doing me good. Gosh it's a slow process.

## Reflections

So here I sit in December. I'm on the mend as best I can tell. I'm stretching, I'm gyming, I'm pilates-ing. I'm not driving much. I'm eating less crisps, I'm eating more protein. I'm drinking less.

The emotions I'll remember the most from this year are vulnerability and gratitude.

On vulnerability: there were a number of times this year when I felt I had nothing to offer. I was suffering. I couldn't work. I couldn't be an effective father or husband. I was scared. I thought I might never work again. The world around me, was getting nothing out of me. In that time, everything was hard and I was incredibly sad. I wasn't myself. I wasn't the person I like being. But as I was suffering, I noticed a glorious thing:

People were kind to me.

As I dealt with the most difficult set of circumstances life had yet thrown at me, I knew the people around me cared. Friends checked in on how I was doing. Some told me they were praying for me. I'm a man of faith, I was praying as well. At work folk intentionally created space for me to try and heal. My boys and my wife hugged me and reminded me they loved me regularly. 

I should not be surprised by this. I'd hope that I'm this kind of person to those around me in their time of need. But honestly I was surprised. I'll say it again: people were kind to me. And that meant, that means, such a lot.

This has been hard. Quite possibly you are one of the people who has helped me this year. Perhaps only in a small way. Maybe you've helped me in a way you consider so insignificant as to be not worth noticing. I noticed it. Thank you. I mean that most sincerely. Thank you.

People have loved me, continue to love me. I wanted to take a moment to explicitly call it out. I'm really grateful to you. Thank you for the kindness. Thank you. ♥️
