Am shocked and appalled. Lisette and I had moved on from Ambois to Blois (about 20 minutes up river) and were exploring the local market. Very scenic, rotisseries full of chicken being roasted, stalls carrying great wedges of nasally powerful cheese. Interesting soap, you know the like. The marketplace was crawling with people and as we stood taking it in I felt a slight prod behind me. When I turned around I realised a French woman on a bike (say early-40s) had just run into me. I moved aside and watched her cycle on through the marketplace colliding with people as she went. Perhaps unsurprisingly, not everyone took this well. An old man (80+ if he was a day) who was on the receiving end of one of her collisions with the masses took umbrage. He bellowed something French at her and waving his arms chased after the woman through the marketplace in the style of a zombie in Dawn of the Dead. She, for her part, was as interested in this as the rest of us and stopped on her bike to watch the strange not quite undead man scampering in her direction. What happened next was unexpected. The man reached the woman and without pausing for breath (which zombies probably dont need anyway) he struck her full in the face. There followed that sort of stunned silence that follows a shock to the normal social cohesion.

<p>Happy to report that I am now a well man. Lisette on the other hand has completely caught what I have and is suffering. Fortunately we&#x27;ve now made it down to Ken and Annies in Moraira (Spain) and so Lisette is being well cared for... See you soon, John and Lisette <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/reillys-on-tour/assets/images/P1020181-8ddd92cd2d4f61520c37cce07318f358.JPG" width="320" height="240" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/johnnyreilly/reillys-on-tour/tree/main/edit/blog/2010-09-21-witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/reillys-on-tour/big-hands"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Big hands</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/reillys-on-tour/crash-or-how-my-digestive-system"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">The Crash (or How My Digestive System Unfurled Le Blanc Flag and Waived Like a Mad Thing)</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#slug-witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">slug: witness-to-crime-i-know-kung-fu</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 John Reilly.
